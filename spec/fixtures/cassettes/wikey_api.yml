        officially the <b>Republic of China</b> (<b>ROC</b>), is a state in East Asia.
        Its neighbors include the People''s Republic of China to the west, Japan to
        the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous
        state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations.</p>\n<p>The
        island of Taiwan, formerly known as Formosa, was inhabited by Taiwanese aborigines
        before the 17th century, when Dutch and Spanish colonies opened the island
        to mass Han immigration. After a brief rule by the Kingdom of Tungning, the
        island was annexed by the Qing dynasty, the last dynasty of China. The Qing
        ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895 after the Sino-Japanese War. While Taiwan was
        under Japanese rule, the Republic of China (ROC) was established on the mainland
        in 1912 after the fall of the Qing dynasty. Following the Japanese surrender
        to the Allies in 1945, the ROC took control of Taiwan. However, the resumption
        of the Chinese Civil War led to the ROC''s loss of the mainland to the Communists,
        and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949. Although the ROC continued
        to claim to be the legitimate government of China, its effective jurisdiction
        has, since the loss of Hainan in 1950, been limited to Taiwan and its surrounding
        islands, with the main island making up 99% of its <i>de facto</i> territory.
        As a founding member of the United Nations, the ROC continued to represent
        China at the United Nations until 1971, when the PRC assumed China''s seat,
        causing the ROC to lose its UN membership.</p>\n<p>In the early 1960s, Taiwan
        entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialization, creating
        a stable industrial economy. In the 1980s and early 1990s, it changed from
        a one-party military dictatorship dominated by the Kuomintang to a multi-party
        democracy with a semi-presidential system. Taiwan is the 22nd-largest economy
        in the world, and its high-tech industry plays a key role in the global economy.
        It is ranked highly in terms of freedom of the press, healthcare, public education,
        economic freedom, and human development. The country benefits from a highly
        skilled workforce and is among the most highly educated countries in the world
        with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education
        degree.</p>\n<p>The PRC has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and
        asserted the ROC is no longer in legitimate existence. Under its One-China
        Policy the PRC refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes
        the ROC. Today 20 countries maintain official ties with the ROC but many other
        states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices and institutions
        that function as <i>de facto</i> embassies and consulates. Although Taiwan
        is fully self-governing, most international organizations in which the PRC
        participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate
        only as a non-state actor. Internally, the major division in politics is between
        the aspirations of eventual Chinese unification or Taiwanese independence,
        though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal.
        The PRC has threatened the use of military force in response to any formal
        declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful
        unification is no longer possible.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n\n<p>There
        are various names for the island of Taiwan in use today, derived from explorers
        or rulers by each particular period. The former name Formosa (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u798f\u723e\u6469\u6c99</span>)
        dates from 1542, when Portuguese sailors sighted the main island of Taiwan
        and named it <i>Ilha Formosa</i>, which means \"beautiful island\". The name
        \"Formosa\" eventually \"replaced all others in European literature\" and
        was in common use in English in the early 20th century.</p>\n<p>In the early
        17th century, the Dutch East India Company established a commercial post at
        Fort Zeelandia (modern-day Anping, Tainan) on a coastal sandbar called \"Tayouan\",
        after their ethnonym for a nearby Taiwanese aboriginal tribe, written by the
        Dutch and Portuguese variously as <i>Taiouwang</i>, <i>Tayowan</i>, <i>Teijoan</i>,
        etc. This name was also adopted into the Chinese vernacular (in particular,
        Hokkien, as Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: <i><span lang=\"nan\">T\u0101i-o\u00e2n/T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n</span></i>)
        as the name of the sandbar and nearby area (Tainan). The modern word \"Taiwan\"
        is derived from this usage, which is seen in various forms (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u5927\u54e1,
        \u5927\u5713, \u5927\u7063, \u81fa\u54e1, \u81fa\u5713</span> and <span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u81fa\u7aa9\u7063</span>)
        in Chinese historical records. The area of modern-day Tainan was the first
        permanent settlement by Western colonists and Chinese immigrants, grew to
        be the most important trading centre, and served as the capital of the island
        until 1887. Use of the current Chinese name (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u81fa\u7063</span>)
        was formalized as early as 1684 with the establishment of Taiwan Prefecture.
        Through its rapid development, the entire Formosan mainland eventually became
        known as \"Taiwan\".</p>\n<p>In his <i>Daoyi Zhil\u00fce</i> (1349), Wang
        Dayuan used \"Liuqiu\" as a name for the island of Taiwan, or the part of
        it near to Penghu. Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in
        general or Okinawa, the largest of them; indeed the name <i>Ry\u016bky\u016b</i>
        is the Japanese form of <i>Li\u00faqi\u00fa</i>. The name also appears in
        the <i>Book of Sui</i> (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree
        on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even Luzon.</p>\n<p>The
        official name of the state is the \"Republic of China\"; it has also been
        known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC''s
        establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland,
        the government used the short form \"China\" <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3</span></i>
        <span>(<span lang=\"zh\">\u4e2d\u570b</span>),</span> to refer to itself,
        which derives from <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">zh\u014dng</span></i>
        (\"central\" or \"middle\") and <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">gu\u00f3</span></i>
        (\"state, nation-state\"),  A term which also developed under the Zhou Dynasty
        in reference to its royal demesne and the name was then applied to the area
        around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China''s
        Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under
        the Qingera . During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had fled to
        Taiwan due to losing the Chinese Civil War, it was commonly referred to as
        \"<b>Nationalist China</b>\" (or \"Free China\") to differentiate it from
        \"Communist China\" (or \"Red China\"). It was a member of the United Nations
        representing \"<i>China</i>\" until 1971, when it lost its seat to the People''s
        Republic of China. Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become
        commonly known as \"Taiwan\", after the island that comprises 99% of the territory
        under its control. In some contexts, especially official ones from the ROC
        government, the name is written as \"Republic of China (Taiwan)\", \"Republic
        of China/Taiwan\", or sometimes \"Taiwan (ROC).\" The Republic of China participates
        in most international forums and organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei\"
        due to diplomatic pressure from the People''s Republic of China. For instance,
        it is the name under which it has competed at the Olympic Games since 1984,
        and its name as an observer at the World Health Organization.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Prehistoric_Taiwan\">Prehistoric
        Taiwan</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Taiwan was joined to the mainland in the Late Pleistocene,
        until sea levels rose about 10,000 years ago. Fragmentary human remains dated
        20,000 to 30,000 years ago have been found on the island, as well as later
        artefacts of a Paleolithic culture.</p>\n<p>Around 6,000 years ago, Taiwan
        was settled by farmers, most likely from mainland China. They are believed
        to be the ancestors of today''s Taiwanese aborigines, whose languages belong
        to the Austronesian language family, but show much greater diversity than
        the rest of the family, which spans a huge area from Maritime Southeast Asia
        west to Madagascar and east as far as New Zealand, Hawaii and Easter Island.
        This has led linguists to propose Taiwan as the urheimat of the family, from
        which seafaring peoples dispersed across Southeast Asia and the Pacific and
        Indian Oceans.</p>\n<p>Han Chinese fishermen began settling in the Penghu
        islands in the 13th century. Hostile tribes, and a lack of valuable trade
        products, meant that few outsiders visited the main island until the 16th
        century. By the 1700''s visits to the coast by fishermen from Fujian, as well
        as Chinese and Japanese pirates, became more frequent.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Opening_in_the_17th_century\">Opening
        in the 17th century</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The Dutch East India Company attempted
        to establish a trading outpost on the Penghu Islands (Pescadores) in 1622,
        but were militarily defeated and driven off by the Ming authorities.</p>\n<p>In
        1624, the company established a stronghold called Fort Zeelandia on the coastal
        islet of Tayouan, which is now part of the main island at Anping, Tainan.
        David Wright, a Scottish agent of the company who lived on the island in the
        1650s, described the lowland areas of the island as being divided among 11
        chiefdoms ranging in size from two settlements to 72. Some of these fell under
        Dutch control, while others remained independent. The Company began to import
        labourers from Fujian and Penghu (Pescadores), many of whom settled.</p>\n<p>In
        1626, the Spanish Empire landed on and occupied northern Taiwan, at the ports
        of Keelung and Tamsui, as a base to extend their trading. This colonial period
        lasted 16 years until 1642, when the last Spanish fortress fell to Dutch forces.</p>\n<p>Following
        the fall of the Ming dynasty, Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), a self-styled Ming
        loyalist, arrived on the island and captured Fort Zeelandia in 1662, expelling
        the Dutch Empire and military from the island. Koxinga established the Kingdom
        of Tungning (1662\u20131683), with his capital at Tainan. He and his heirs,
        Zheng Jing, who ruled from 1662 to 1682, and Zheng Keshuang, who ruled less
        than a year, continued to launch raids on the southeast coast of mainland
        China well into the Qing dynasty era.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Qing_rule\">Qing
        rule</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>In 1683, following the defeat of Koxinga''s grandson
        by an armada led by Admiral Shi Lang of southern Fujian, the Qing dynasty
        formally annexed Taiwan, placing it under the jurisdiction of Fujian province.
        The Qing imperial government tried to reduce piracy and vagrancy in the area,
        issuing a series of edicts to manage immigration and respect aboriginal land
        rights. Immigrants mostly from southern Fujian continued to enter Taiwan.
        The border between taxpaying lands and \"savage\" lands shifted eastward,
        with some aborigines becoming sinicized while others retreated into the mountains.
        During this time, there were a number of conflicts between groups of Han Chinese
        from different regions of southern Fujian, particularly between those from
        Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, and between southern Fujian Chinese and aborigines.</p>\n<p>Northern
        Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were the scene of subsidiary campaigns in the
        Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885). The French occupied Keelung on
        1 October 1884, but were repulsed from Tamsui a few days later. The French
        won some tactical victories but were unable to exploit them, and the Keelung
        Campaign ended in stalemate. The Pescadores Campaign, beginning on 31 March
        1885, was a French victory, but had no long-term consequences. The French
        evacuated both Keelung and the Penghu archipelago after the end of the war.</p>\n<p>In
        1887, the Qing upgraded the island''s administration from Taiwan Prefecture
        of Fujian to Fujian-Taiwan-Province (\u798f\u5efa\u81fa\u7063\u7701), the
        twentieth in the empire, with its capital at Taipei. This was accompanied
        by a modernization drive that included building China''s first railroad.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Japanese_rule\">Japanese rule</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>As the Qing dynasty
        was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895), Taiwan, along
        with Penghu and Liaodong Peninsula, were ceded in full sovereignty to the
        Empire of Japan by the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Inhabitants on Taiwan and Penghu
        wishing to remain Qing subjects were given a two-year grace period to sell
        their property and move to mainland China. Very few Taiwanese saw this as
        feasible. On 25 May 1895, a group of pro-Qing high officials proclaimed the
        Republic of Formosa to resist impending Japanese rule. Japanese forces entered
        the capital at Tainan and quelled this resistance on 21 October 1895. Guerrilla
        fighting continued periodically until about 1902 and ultimately took the lives
        of 14,000 Taiwanese, or 0.5% of the population. Several subsequent rebellions
        against the Japanese (the Beipu uprising of 1907, the Tapani incident of 1915,
        and the Musha incident of 1930) were all unsuccessful but demonstrated opposition
        to Japanese colonial rule.</p>\n<p>Japanese colonial rule was instrumental
        in the industrialization of the island, extending the railroads and other
        transportation networks, building an extensive sanitation system, and establishing
        a formal education system. Japanese rule ended the practice of headhunting.
        During this period the human and natural resources of Taiwan were used to
        aid the development of Japan and the production of cash crops such as rice
        and sugar greatly increased. By 1939, Taiwan was the seventh greatest sugar
        producer in the world. Still, the Taiwanese and aborigines were classified
        as second- and third-class citizens. After suppressing Chinese guerrillas
        in the first decade of their rule, Japanese authorities engaged in a series
        of bloody campaigns against the mountain aboriginals, culminating in the Musha
        Incident of 1930. Intellectuals and laborers who participated in left-wing
        movements within Taiwan were also arrested and massacred (e.g. Tsi\u00fann
        U\u012b-Su\u00ed(\u8523\u6e2d\u6c34), Masanosuke Watanabe (\u6e21\u8fba\u653f\u4e4b\u8f85)).</p>\n<p>Around
        1935, the Japanese began an island-wide assimilation project to bind the island
        more firmly to the Japanese Empire and people were taught to see themselves
        as Japanese under the Kominka Movement, during which time Taiwanese culture
        and religion were outlawed and the citizens were encouraged to adopt Japanese
        surnames. The \"South Strike Group\" was based at the Taihoku Imperial University
        in Taipei. During World War II, tens of thousands of Taiwanese served in the
        Japanese military. For example, former ROC President Lee Teng-hui''s elder
        brother served in the Japanese navy and was killed in action in the Philippines
        in February 1945. The Imperial Japanese Navy operated heavily out of Taiwanese
        ports. In October 1944, the Formosa Air Battle was fought between American
        carriers and Japanese forces based in Taiwan. Important Japanese military
        bases and industrial centres throughout Taiwan, like Kaohsiung, were targets
        of heavy American bombings. Also during this time, over 2,000 women were forced
        into sexual slavery for Imperial Japanese troops, now euphemistically called
        \"comfort women.\"</p>\n<p>In 1938, there were 309,000 Japanese settlers in
        Taiwan. After World War II, most of the Japanese were expelled and sent to
        Japan.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Republic_of_China\">Republic of China</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During
        Japanese rule of Taiwan, on 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was declared
        with Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (the KMT or Nationalist Party) was proclaimed
        provisional president following the Xinhai Revolution, which itself began
        with the Wuchang Uprising on 10 October 1911, overthrowing the Qing Dynasty
        and ending over two thousand years of imperial rule in China. However, the
        presidency was later given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general who in 1915
        proclaimed himself Emperor of China. In the face of popular condemnation and
        opposition from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to abdicate and re-establish
        the republic.</p>\n<p>Since its founding until 1949 it was based on mainland
        China. Central authority waxed and waned in response to warlordism (1915\u201328)
        after Yuan Shikai''s death in 1916,, Japanese invasion (1937\u201345), and
        the Chinese Civil War (1927\u201349), with central authority strongest during
        the Nanjing Decade (1927\u201337), when most of China came under the control
        of the Kuomintang (KMT) under an authoritarian one-party state.</p>\n<p>After
        the Surrender of Japan, on 25 October 1945, the US Navy ferried ROC troops
        to Taiwan in order to accept the formal surrender of Japanese military forces
        in Taipei on behalf of the Allied Powers, as part of General Order No. 1 for
        temporary military occupation. General Rikichi And\u014d, governor-general
        of Taiwan and commander-in-chief of all Japanese forces on the island, signed
        the receipt and handed it over to General Chen Yi of the ROC military to complete
        the official turnover. Chen Yi proclaimed that day to be \"Taiwan Retrocession
        Day\", but the Allies considered Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to be under
        military occupation and still under Japanese sovereignty until 1952, when
        the Treaty of San Francisco took effect. Although the 1943 Cairo Declaration
        had envisaged returning these territories to China, in the Treaty of San Francisco
        and Treaty of Taipei Japan has renounced all claim to them without specifying
        to what country they were to be surrendered. This introduced the problem of
        the legal status of Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The ROC administration of Taiwan under
        Chen Yi was strained by increasing tensions between Taiwanese-born people
        and newly arrived mainlanders, which were compounded by economic woes, such
        as hyperinflation. Furthermore, cultural and linguistic conflicts between
        the two groups quickly led to the loss of popular support for the new government,
        while the mass movement led by the working committee of the Communist Party
        also aimed to bring down the Kuomintang government. The shooting of a civilian
        on 28 February 1947 triggered island-wide unrest, which was suppressed with
        military force in what is now called the February 28 Incident. Mainstream
        estimates of the number killed range from 18,000 to 30,000. Those killed were
        mainly members of the Taiwanese elite.</p>\n\n<p>After the end of World War
        II, the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Chinese Nationalists (Kuomintang),
        led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong.
        Throughout the months of 1949, a series of Chinese Communist offensives led
        to the capture of its capital Nanjing on 23 April and the subsequent defeat
        of the Nationalist army on the mainland, and the Communists founded the People''s
        Republic of China on 1 October.</p>\n<p>On 7 December 1949, after the loss
        of four capitals, Chiang evacuated his Nationalist government to Taiwan and
        made Taipei the temporary capital of the ROC (also called the \"wartime capital\"
        by Chiang Kai-shek). Some 2 million people, consisting mainly of soldiers,
        members of the ruling Kuomintang and intellectual and business elites, were
        evacuated from mainland China to Taiwan at that time, adding to the earlier
        population of approximately six million. In addition, the ROC government took
        to Taipei many national treasures and much of China''s gold reserves and foreign
        currency reserves.</p>\n<p>After losing most of the mainland, the Kuomintang
        held remaining control of Tibet, the portions of Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Yunnan
        provinces along with the Hainan Island until 1951 before the Communists subsequently
        captured both territories. From this point onwards, the Kuomintang''s territory
        was reduced to Taiwan, Penghu, the portions of the Fujian province (Kinmen
        and Matsu Islands), and two major islands of Dongsha Islands and Nansha Islands.
        The Kuomintang continued to claim sovereignty over all \"China\", which it
        defined to include mainland China, Taiwan, Outer Mongolia and other areas.
        On mainland China, the victorious Communists claimed they ruled the sole and
        only China (which they claimed included Taiwan) and that the Republic of China
        no longer existed.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"Chinese_Nationalist_one-party_rule\">Chinese
        Nationalist one-party rule</span></h4>\n<p>Martial law, declared on Taiwan
        in May 1949, continued to be in effect after the central government relocated
        to Taiwan. It was not repealed until 1987, and was used as a way to suppress
        the political opposition in the intervening years. During the White Terror,
        as the period is known, 140,000 people were imprisoned or executed for being
        perceived as anti-KMT or pro-Communist. Many citizens were arrested, tortured,
        imprisoned and executed for their real or perceived link to the Communists.
        Since these people were mainly from the intellectual and social elite, an
        entire generation of political and social leaders was decimated. In 1998 law
        was passed to create the \"Compensation Foundation for Improper Verdicts\"
        which oversaw compensation to White Terror victims and families. President
        Ma Ying-jeou made an official apology in 2008, expressing hope that there
        will never be a tragedy similar to White Terror.</p>\n<p>Initially, the United
        States abandoned the KMT and expected that Taiwan would fall to the Communists.
        However, in 1950 the conflict between North Korea and South Korea, which had
        been ongoing since the Japanese withdrawal in 1945, escalated into full-blown
        war, and in the context of the Cold War, US President Harry S. Truman intervened
        again and dispatched the US Navy''s 7th Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent
        hostilities between Taiwan and mainland China. In the Treaty of San Francisco
        and the Treaty of Taipei, which came into force respectively on 28 April 1952
        and 5 August 1952, Japan formally renounced all right, claim and title to
        Taiwan and Penghu, and renounced all treaties signed with China before 1942.
        Neither treaty specified to whom sovereignty over the islands should be transferred,
        because the United States and the United Kingdom disagreed on whether the
        ROC or the PRC was the legitimate government of China. Continuing conflict
        of the Chinese Civil War through the 1950s, and intervention by the United
        States notably resulted in legislation such as the Sino-American Mutual Defense
        Treaty and the Formosa Resolution of 1955.</p>\n\n<p>As the Chinese Civil
        War continued without truce, the government built up military fortifications
        throughout Taiwan. Within this effort, KMT veterans built the now famous Central
        Cross-Island Highway through the Taroko Gorge in the 1950s. The two sides
        would continue to engage in sporadic military clashes with seldom publicized
        details well into the 1960s on the China coastal islands with an unknown number
        of night raids. During the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in September 1958,
        Taiwan''s landscape saw Nike-Hercules missile batteries added, with the formation
        of the 1st Missile Battalion Chinese Army that would not be deactivated until
        1997. Newer generations of missile batteries have since replaced the Nike
        Hercules systems throughout the island.</p>\n<p>During the 1960s and 1970s,
        the ROC maintained an authoritarian, single-party government while its economy
        became industrialized and technology oriented. This rapid economic growth,
        known as the Taiwan Miracle, was the result of a fiscal regime independent
        from mainland China and backed up, among others, by the support of US funds
        and demand for Taiwanese products. In the 1970s, Taiwan was economically the
        second fastest growing state in Asia after Japan. Taiwan, along with Hong
        Kong, South Korea and Singapore, became known as one of the Four Asian Tigers.
        Because of the Cold War, most Western nations and the United Nations regarded
        the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China until the 1970s. Later,
        especially after the termination of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty,
        most nations switched diplomatic recognition to the PRC (see United Nations
        General Assembly Resolution 2758).</p>\n<p>Up until the 1970s, the government
        was regarded by Western critics as undemocratic for upholding martial law,
        for severely repressing any political opposition and for controlling media.
        The KMT did not allow the creation of new parties and those that existed did
        not seriously compete with the KMT. Thus, competitive democratic elections
        did not exist. From the late 1970s to the 1990s, however, Taiwan went through
        reforms and social changes that transformed it from an authoritarian state
        to a democracy. In 1979, a pro-democracy protest known as the Kaohsiung Incident
        took place in Kaohsiung to celebrate Human Rights Day. Although the protest
        was rapidly crushed by the authorities, it is today considered as the main
        event that united Taiwan''s opposition.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Democratization\">Democratization</span></h4>\n\n<p>Chiang
        Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek''s son and successor as the president, began to
        liberalize the political system in the mid-1980s. In 1984, the younger Chiang
        selected Lee Teng-hui, a Taiwanese-born, US-educated technocrat, to be his
        vice-president. In 1986, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was formed
        and inaugurated as the first opposition party in the ROC to counter the KMT.
        A year later, Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law on the main island of Taiwan
        (martial law was lifted on Penghu in 1979, Matsu island in 1992 and Kinmen
        island in 1993). With the advent of democratization, the issue of the political
        status of Taiwan gradually resurfaced as a controversial issue where, previously,
        the discussion of anything other than unification under the ROC was taboo.</p>\n<p>After
        the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, Lee Teng-hui succeeded him
        as president. Lee continued to democratize the government and decrease the
        concentration of government authority in the hands of mainland Chinese. Under
        Lee, Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which Taiwanese culture
        and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint in contrast to earlier
        KMT policies which had promoted a Chinese identity. Lee''s reforms included
        printing banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of
        Taiwan, and streamlining the Taiwan Provincial Government with most of its
        functions transferred to the Executive Yuan. Under Lee, the original members
        of the Legislative Yuan and National Assembly(a former supreme legislative
        body defunct in 2005\uff09, elected in 1947 to represent mainland Chinese
        constituencies and having held the seats without re-election for more than
        four decades, were forced to resign in 1991. The previously nominal representation
        in the Legislative Yuan was brought to an end, reflecting the reality that
        the ROC had no jurisdiction over mainland China, and vice versa. Restrictions
        on the use of Taiwanese Hokkien in the broadcast media and in schools were
        also lifted.</p>\n\n<p>Democratic reforms continued in the 1990s, with Lee
        Teng-hui re-elected in 1996, in the first direct presidential election in
        the history of the ROC. During the later years of Lee''s administration, he
        was involved in corruption controversies relating to government release of
        land and weapons purchase, although no legal proceedings commenced. In 1997,\"To
        meet the requisites of the nation prior to national unification\", the Additional
        Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China was passed and then
        the former \"constitution of five powers\" turns to be more tripartite. In
        2000, Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party was elected as the
        first non-Kuomintang (KMT) President and was re-elected to serve his second
        and last term since 2004. Polarized politics has emerged in Taiwan with the
        formation of the Pan-Blue Coalition of parties led by the KMT, favouring eventual
        Chinese reunification, and the Pan-Green Coalition of parties led by the DPP,
        favouring an eventual and official declaration of Taiwanese independence.
        In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian remarked: \u201cThe National Unification
        Council will cease to function. No budget will be ear-marked for it and its
        personnel must return to their original posts...The National Unification Guidelines
        will cease to apply.\"</p>\n\n<p>On 30 September 2007, the ruling DPP approved
        a resolution asserting a separate identity from China and called for the enactment
        of a new constitution for a \"normal country\". It also called for general
        use of \"Taiwan\" as the country''s name, without abolishing its formal name,
        the Republic of China. The Chen administration also pushed for referendums
        on national defence and UN entry in the 2004 and 2008 elections, which failed
        due to voter turnout below the required legal threshold of 50% of all registered
        voters. The Chen administration was dogged by public concerns over reduced
        economic growth, legislative gridlock due to a pan-blue, opposition-controlled
        Legislative Yuan and corruption involving the First Family as well as government
        officials.</p>\n<p>The KMT increased its majority in the Legislative Yuan
        in the January 2008 legislative elections, while its nominee Ma Ying-jeou
        went on to win the presidency in March of the same year, campaigning on a
        platform of increased economic growth and better ties with the PRC under a
        policy of \"mutual nondenial\". Ma took office on 20 May 2008, the same day
        that President Chen Shui-bian stepped down and was notified by prosecutors
        of possible corruption charges. Part of the rationale for campaigning for
        closer economic ties with the PRC stems from the strong economic growth China
        attained since joining the World Trade Organization. However, some analysts
        say that despite the election of Ma Ying-jeou, the diplomatic and military
        tensions with the PRC have not been reduced.</p>\n<p>On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional
        Court ruled that current marriage laws are unconstitutional and that same-sex
        couples in the Taiwanese LGBT community should have the right to marry. The
        court has given the Legislative Yuan two years to adequately amend Taiwanese
        marriage laws. According to the court ruling, if amendments are not passed
        within two years, same-sex marriages will automatically become legal in Taiwan.</p>\n<h2><span

        making it the world''s 137th-largest country/dependency, smaller than Switzerland
        and larger than Belgium.</p>\n<p>The island of Taiwan has an area of 35,883\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>
        (13,855\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and lies some 180 kilometres (110\u00a0mi) from
        the southeastern coast of mainland China across the Taiwan Strait. The East
        China Sea lies to the north, the Philippine Sea to the east, the Bashi Channel
        of the Luzon Strait directly to the south, and the South China Sea to the
        southwest. Its shape is similar to a sweet potato, giving rise to the name
        <i>sweet potato</i> used by Taiwanese Hokkien speakers for people of Taiwanese
        descent.</p>\n<p>The island is characterized by the contrast between the eastern
        two-thirds, consisting mostly of rugged mountains running in five ranges from
        the northern to the southern tip of the island, and the flat to gently rolling
        Chianan Plains in the west that are also home to most of Taiwan''s population.
        Taiwan''s highest point is Yu Shan (Jade Mountain) at 3,952 metres (12,966\u00a0ft),
        making Taiwan the world''s fourth-highest island.</p>\n<p>The Penghu Islands,
        50\u00a0km (31.1\u00a0mi) west of the main island, have an area of 126.9\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>
        (49.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). More distant islands controlled by the Republic of
        China are the Kinmen, Wuchiu and Matsu Islands off the coast of Fujian, with
        a total area of 180.5\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (69.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and the

        of 2.9\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (1.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and no permanent inhabitants.
        The ROC government also claims the Senkaku Islands to the northeast, which
        are controlled by Japan.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Climate\">Climate</span></h3>\n<p>Taiwan
        lies on the Tropic of Cancer, and its general climate is marine tropical.
        The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical
        and the mountainous regions are temperate. The average rainfall is 2,600 millimetres
        (100 inches) per year for the island proper; the rainy season is concurrent
        with the onset of the summer East Asian Monsoon in May and June. The entire
        island experiences hot, humid weather from June through September. Typhoons
        are most common in July, August and September. During the winter (November
        to March), the northeast experiences steady rain, while the central and southern
        parts of the island are mostly sunny.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Geology\">Geology</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        island of Taiwan lies in a complex tectonic area between the Yangtze Plate
        to the west and north, the Okinawa Plate on the north-east, and the Philippine
        Mobile Belt on the east and south. The upper part of the crust on the island
        is primarily made up of a series of terranes, mostly old island arcs which
        have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the Eurasian
        Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. These have been further uplifted as a
        result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was subducted
        beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust
        under Taiwan more buoyant.</p>\n<p>The east and south of Taiwan are a complex
        system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between
        the North Luzon Trough portion of the Luzon Volcanic Arc and South China,
        where accreted portions of the Luzon Arc and Luzon forearc form the eastern
        Coastal Range and parallel inland Longitudinal Valley of Taiwan respectively.</p>\n<p>The
        major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between
        the various terranes. These have produced major quakes throughout the history
        of the island. On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the \"921 earthquake\"
        killed more than 2,400 people. The seismic hazard map for Taiwan by the USGS
        shows 9/10 of the island as the highest rating (most hazardous).</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Political_and_legal_status\">Political and legal status</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The
        political and legal statuses of Taiwan are contentious issues. The People''s
        Republic of China (PRC) claims that the Republic of China government is illegitimate,
        referring to it as the \"Taiwan Authority\" even though current ROC territories
        have never been controlled by the PRC. The ROC has its own constitution, independently
        elected president and armed forces. It has not formally renounced its claim
        to the mainland, but ROC government publications have increasingly downplayed
        it.</p>\n<p>Internationally, there is controversy on whether the ROC still
        exists as a state or a defunct state per international law due to the lack
        of wide diplomatic recognition. In a poll of Taiwanese aged 20 and older taken
        by TVBS in March 2009, a majority of 64% opted for the \"status quo\", while
        19% favoured \"independence\" and 5% favoured \"unification\".</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Relations_with_the_PRC\">Relations with the PRC</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        political environment is complicated by the potential for military conflict
        should Taiwan declare de jure independence; it is the official PRC policy
        to use force to ensure unification if peaceful unification is no longer possible,
        as stated in its anti-secession law, and for this reason there are substantial
        military installations on the Fujian coast.</p>\n<p>On 29 April 2005, Kuomintang
        Chairman Lien Chan travelled to Beijing and met with Communist Party of China
        (CPC) Secretary-General Hu Jintao, the first meeting between the leaders of
        the two parties since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. On 11 February
        2014, Mainland Affairs Council Head Wang Yu-chi travelled to Nanjing and met
        with Taiwan Affairs Office Head Zhang Zhijun, the first meeting between high-ranking
        officials from either side. Zhang paid a reciprocal visit to Taiwan and met
        Wang on 25 June 2014, making Zhang the first minister-level PRC official to
        ever visit Taiwan. On 7 November 2015, Ma Ying-jeou (in his capacity as <i>Leader
        of Taiwan</i>) and Xi Jinping (in his capacity as <i>Leader of Mainland China</i>)
        travelled to Singapore and met up, marking the highest-level exchange between
        the two sides since 1949.</p>\n<p>The PRC supports a version of the One-China
        policy, which states that Taiwan and mainland China are both part of China,
        and that the PRC is the only legitimate government of China. It uses this
        policy to prevent the international recognition of the ROC as an independent
        sovereign state, meaning that Taiwan participates in international forums
        under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". With the emergence of the Taiwanese independence
        movement, the name \"Taiwan\" has been employed increasingly often on the
        island.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Foreign_relations\">Foreign relations</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before
        1928, the foreign policy of Republican China was complicated by a lack of
        internal unity\u2014competing centres of power all claimed legitimacy. This
        situation changed after the defeat of the Peiyang Government by the Kuomintang,
        which led to widespread diplomatic recognition of the Republic of China.</p>\n<p>After
        the KMT''s retreat to Taiwan, most countries, notably the countries in the
        Western Bloc, continued to maintain relations with the ROC. Due to diplomatic
        pressure, recognition gradually eroded and many countries switched recognition
        to the PRC in the 1970s. UN Resolution 2758 (25 October 1971) recognized the
        People''s Republic of China as China''s sole representative in the United
        Nations.</p>\n<p>The PRC refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation
        that recognizes the ROC, and requires all nations with which it has diplomatic
        relations to make a statement recognizing its claims to Taiwan. As a result,
        only 19\u00a0UN member states and the Holy See maintain official diplomatic
        relations with the Republic of China. The ROC maintains unofficial relations
        with most countries via <i>de facto</i> embassies and consulates called Taipei
        Economic and Cultural Representative Offices (TECRO), with branch offices
        called \"Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices\" (TECO). Both TECRO and TECO
        are \"unofficial commercial entities\" of the ROC in charge of maintaining
        diplomatic relations, providing consular services (i.e. visa applications),
        and serving the national interests of the ROC in other countries.</p>\n<p>The
        United States remains one of the main allies of the country and, through the
        Taiwan Relations Act passed in 1979, has continued selling arms and providing
        military training to the Armed Forces. This situation continues to be an issue
        for the People''s Republic of China which considers US involvement disruptive
        to the stability of the region. In January 2010, the Obama administration
        announced its intention to sell $6.4 billion worth of military hardware to
        Taiwan. As a consequence, the PRC threatened the US with economic sanctions
        and warned that their co-operation on international and regional issues could
        suffer.</p>\n<p>The official position of the United States is that the PRC
        is expected to \"use no force or threat[en] to use force against Taiwan\"
        and the ROC is to \"exercise prudence in managing all aspects of Cross-Strait
        relations.\" Both are to refrain from performing actions or espousing statements
        \"that would unilaterally alter Taiwan''s status.\"</p>\n<p>On 16 December
        2015, the Obama administration announced a deal to sell $1.83 billion worth
        of arms to the armed forces of the ROC. China''s foreign ministry had expressed
        its disapproval for the sales and issued the US a \"stern warning\", saying
        it would hurt China\u2013US relations.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Participation_in_international_events_and_organizations\">Participation
        in international events and organizations</span></h3>\n\n<p>The ROC was a
        founding member of the United Nations, and held the seat of China on the Security
        Council and other UN bodies until 1971, when it was expelled by Resolution
        2758 and replaced in all UN organs with the PRC. Each year since 1992, the
        ROC has petitioned the UN for entry, but its applications have not made it
        past committee.</p>\n\n<p>Due to its limited international recognition, the
        Republic of China is a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization,
        represented by a government-funded organization, the Taiwan Foundation for
        Democracy (TFD) under the name \"Taiwan\".</p>\n<p>Also due to its One China
        policy, the PRC only participates in international organizations where the
        ROC is not recognized as a sovereign country. Most member states, including
        the United States, do not wish to discuss the issue of the ROC''s political
        status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the PRC. However, both the
        US and Japan publicly support the ROC''s bid for membership in the World Health
        Organization as an observer. However, though the ROC sought to participate
        in the WHO since 1997, their efforts were blocked by the PRC until 2010, when
        they were invited as observers to attend the World Health Assembly, under
        the name \"Chinese Taipei\".</p>\n<p>Due to PRC pressure, the ROC is forced
        to use the name \"Chinese Taipei\" in international events, such as the Olympic
        Games, where the PRC is also a party. The ROC is typically barred from using
        its national anthem and national flag in international events due to PRC pressure;
        ROC spectators attending events such as the Olympics are often barred from
        bringing ROC flags into venues. Taiwan also participates in the Asia-Pacific
        Economic Cooperation forum (since 1991) and the World Trade Organization (since
        2002) under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". The ROC is able to participate as
        \"China\" in organizations that the PRC does not participate in, such as the
        World Organization of the Scout Movement.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Opinions_within_Taiwan\">Opinions

        KMT, the largest Pan-Blue party, supports the status quo for the indefinite
        future with a stated ultimate goal of unification. However, it does not support
        unification in the short term with the PRC as such a prospect would be unacceptable
        to most of its members and the public. Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the KMT and
        former president of the ROC, has set out democracy, economic development to
        a level near that of Taiwan, and equitable wealth distribution as the conditions
        that the PRC must fulfill for reunification to occur.</p>\n<p>The Democratic
        Progressive Party, the largest Pan-Green party, officially seeks independence,
        but in practice also supports the status quo because its members and the public
        would not accept the risk of provoking the PRC.</p>\n<p>On 2 September 2008,
        Mexican newspaper <i>El Sol de M\u00e9xico</i> asked President Ma about his
        views on the subject of \"two Chinas\" and if there was a solution for the
        sovereignty issues between the two. The president replied that the relations
        are neither between two Chinas nor two states. It is a special relationship.
        Further, he stated that the sovereignty issues between the two cannot be resolved
        at present, but he quoted the \"1992 Consensus\", currently accepted by both
        the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China, as a temporary measure until
        a solution becomes available.</p>\n<p>On 27 September 2017, Taiwanese premier
        William Lai said that he was a \u201cpolitical worker who advocates Taiwan
        independence\u201d, but that as Taiwan was an independent country called the
        Republic of China, it had no need to declare independence. The relationship
        with the PRC and the related issues of Taiwanese independence and Chinese
        unification continue to dominate politics.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Government_and_politics\">Government
        and politics</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The government of the Republic of China
        was founded on the Constitution of the ROC and its Three Principles of the
        People, which states that the ROC \"shall be a democratic republic of the
        people, to be governed by the people and for the people.\" The government
        is divided into five branches (<i>Yuan</i>): the Executive Yuan (cabinet),
        the Legislative Yuan (Congress or Parliament), the Judicial Yuan, the Control
        Yuan (audit agency), and the Examination Yuan (civil service examination agency).
        The constitution was drafted before the fall of mainland China to the Communist
        Party of China. It was created by the KMT for the purpose of all of its claimed
        territory, including Taiwan, even though the Communist Party boycotted the
        drafting of the constitution. The constitution went into effect on 25 December
        1947. The ROC remained under martial law from 1948 until 1987 and much of
        the constitution was not in effect. Political reforms beginning in the late
        1970s and continuing through the early 1990s liberalized the country and transformed
        into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic
        of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components
        that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment
        continues. In 2000, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidency,
        ending KMT''s continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National
        Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement
        several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National
        Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of
        constitutional reform to the popular ballot.</p>\n<p>The head of state and
        commander-in-chief of the armed forces is the president, who is elected by
        popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the
        vice-president. The president has authority over the Yuan. The president appoints
        the members of the Executive Yuan as his cabinet, including a premier, who
        is officially the President of the Executive Yuan; members are responsible
        for policy and administration.</p>\n<p>The main legislative body is the unicameral
        Legislative Yuan with 113 seats. Seventy-three are elected by popular vote
        from single-member constituencies; thirty-four are elected based on the proportion
        of nationwide votes received by participating political parties in a separate
        party list ballot; and six are elected from two three-member aboriginal constituencies.
        Members serve four-year terms. Originally the unicameral National Assembly,
        as a standing constitutional convention and electoral college, held some parliamentary
        functions, but the National Assembly was abolished in 2005 with the power
        of constitutional amendments handed over to the Legislative Yuan and all eligible
        voters of the Republic via referendums.</p>\n<p>The premier is selected by
        the president without the need for approval from the legislature, but the
        legislature can pass laws without regard for the president, as neither he
        nor the Premier wields veto power. Thus, there is little incentive for the
        president and the legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing
        parties. After the election of the pan-Green''s Chen Shui-bian as President
        in 2000, legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the Legislative
        Yuan, which was controlled by a pan-Blue majority. Historically, the ROC has
        been dominated by strongman single party politics. This legacy has resulted
        in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the president
        rather than the premier, even though the constitution does not explicitly
        state the extent of the president''s executive power.</p>\n<p>The Judicial
        Yuan is the highest judicial organ. It interprets the constitution and other
        laws and decrees, judges administrative suits, and disciplines public functionaries.
        The president and vice-president of the Judicial Yuan and additional thirteen
        justices form the Council of Grand Justices. They are nominated and appointed
        by the president, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The highest court,
        the Supreme Court, consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each
        of which is formed by a presiding judge and four associate judges, all appointed
        for life. In 1993, a separate constitutional court was established to resolve
        constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and
        accelerate the democratization process. There is no trial by jury but the
        right to a fair public trial is protected by law and respected in practice;
        many cases are presided over by multiple judges.</p>\n\n<p>Capital punishment
        is still used in Taiwan, although efforts have been made by the government
        to reduce the number of executions. Nevertheless, according to a survey in
        2006, about 80% of Taiwanese still wanted to keep the death penalty.</p>\n<p>The
        Control Yuan is a watchdog agency that monitors (controls) the actions of
        the executive. It can be considered a standing commission for administrative
        inquiry and can be compared to the Court of Auditors of the European Union
        or the Government Accountability Office of the United States.</p>\n<p>The
        Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants.
        It is based on the old imperial examination system used in dynastic China.
        It can be compared to the European Personnel Selection Office of the European
        Union or the Office of Personnel Management of the United States.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Major_camps\">Major camps</span></h3>\n\n<p>The tension between China
        and Taiwan colours most of the political life, and any government move towards
        \"Taiwan independence\" is met by threat of military attack from the PRC.
        The PRC''s official policy is to reunify Taiwan and mainland China under the
        formula of \"one country, two systems\" and refuses to renounce the use of
        military force, especially should Taiwan seek a declaration of independence.</p>\n<p>The
        political scene is generally divided into two major camps in terms of views
        on how Taiwan should relate to China or the PRC, referred to as cross-Strait
        relations. It is the main political difference between two camps: the Pan-Blue
        Coalition, composed of the pro-unification Kuomintang, People First Party
        (PFP), and New Party, who believe that the ROC is the sole legitimate government
        of \"China\" (including Taiwan) and supports eventual Chinese reunification.
        The opposition Pan-Green Coalition is composed of the pro-independence DPP
        and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU). It regards Taiwan as an independent, sovereign
        state synonymous with the ROC, opposes the definition that Taiwan is part
        of \"China\", and seeks wide diplomatic recognition and an eventual declaration
        of formal Taiwan independence. The Pan-Green camp tends to favour emphasizing
        the Republic of China as being a distinct country from the People''s Republic
        of China. Thus, in September 2007, the then ruling Democratic Progressive
        Party approved a resolution asserting separate identity from China and called
        for the enactment of a new constitution for a \"<i>normal country</i>\". It
        called also for general use of \"<i>Taiwan</i>\" as the country''s name, without
        abolishing its formal name, the \"Republic of China\". Some members of the
        coalition, such as former President Chen Shui-bian, argue that it is unnecessary
        to proclaim independence because \"Taiwan is already an independent, sovereign
        country\" and the Republic of China is the same as Taiwan. Despite being a
        member of KMT prior to and during his presidency, Lee Teng-hui also held a
        similar view and was a supporter of the Taiwanization movement.</p>\n<p>Pan-Blue
        members generally support the concept of the One-China policy, which states
        that there is only one China and that its only government is the ROC. They
        favour eventual re-unification of China. The more mainstream Pan-Blue position
        is to lift investment restrictions and pursue negotiations with the PRC to
        immediately open direct transportation links. Regarding independence, the
        mainstream Pan-Blue position is to maintain the status quo, while refusing
        immediate reunification. President Ma Ying-jeou stated that there will be
        no unification nor declaration of independence during his presidency. As of
        2009, Pan-Blue members usually seek to improve relationships with mainland
        China, with a current focus on improving economic ties.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Current_political_issues\">Current
        political issues</span></h3>\n<p>The dominant political issue in Taiwan is
        its relationship with the PRC. For almost 60\u00a0years, there were no direct
        transportation links, including direct flights, between Taiwan and mainland
        China. This was a problem for many Taiwanese businesses that had opened factories
        or branches in mainland China. The former DPP administration feared that such
        links would lead to tighter economic and political integration with mainland
        China, and in the 2006 Lunar New Year Speech, President Chen Shui-bian called
        for managed opening of links. Direct weekend charter flights between Taiwan
        and mainland China began in July 2008 under the current KMT government, and
        the first direct daily charter flights took off in December 2008.</p>\n<p>Other
        major political issues include the passage of an arms procurement bill that
        the United States authorized in 2001. In 2008, however, the United States
        was reluctant to send over more arms to Taiwan out of fear that it would hinder
        the recent improvement of ties between the PRC and the ROC. Another major
        political issue is the establishment of a National Communications Commission
        to take over from the Government Information Office, whose advertising budget
        exercised great control over the media.</p>\n<p>The politicians and their
        parties have themselves become major political issues. Corruption among some
        DPP administration officials has been exposed. In early 2006, President Chen
        Shui-bian was linked to possible corruption. The political effect on President
        Chen Shui-bian was great, causing a divide in the DPP leadership and supporters
        alike. It eventually led to the creation of a political camp led by ex-DPP
        leader Shih Ming-teh which believes the president should resign. The KMT assets
        continue to be another major issue, as it was once the richest political party
        in the world. Nearing the end of 2006, KMT''s chairman Ma Ying-jeou was also
        hit by corruption controversies, although he has since then been cleared of
        any wrongdoings by the courts. After completing his second term as President,
        Chen Shui-bian was charged with corruption and money laundering. Following
        his conviction, he is serving a 17-year sentence in Taipei Prison.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"National_identity\">National identity</span></h3>\n\n<p>Roughly 84% of
        Taiwan''s population descends from Han Chinese who migrated from Qing China
        between 1661 and 1895. Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese
        who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The
        shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical
        separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences,
        as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national
        identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratization
        and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed
        to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart
        of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland
        China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for
        <i>de jure</i> Taiwan independence. The pan-green camp supports a distinct
        Taiwanese identity, while the pan-blue camp supports a Chinese identity only.
        The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a
        Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.</p>\n<p>According to a survey
        conducted in March 2009, 49% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese
        only, and 44% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese and Chinese.
        3% consider themselves as only Chinese. Another survey, conducted in Taiwan
        in July 2009, showed that 82.8% of respondents consider the ROC and the PRC
        as two separate countries with each developing on its own. A survey conducted
        in December 2009 showed that 62% of the respondents consider themselves as
        Taiwanese only, and 22% of the respondents consider themselves as both Taiwanese
        and Chinese. 8% consider themselves as only Chinese. The survey also shows
        that among 18- to 29-year-old respondents, 75% consider themselves as Taiwanese
        only.</p>\n<p>In the latest survey conducted by National Chengchi University
        in 2014 and published in early 2015, 60.6% of respondents identified themselves
        exclusively as Taiwanese, 32.5% identified themselves as both Taiwanese and
        Chinese and 3.5% identified themselves as Chinese.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Military\">Military</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The
        Republic of China Army takes its roots in the National Revolutionary Army,
        which was established by Sun Yat-sen in 1925 in Guangdong with a goal of reunifying
        China under the Kuomintang. When the People''s Liberation Army won the Chinese
        Civil War, much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along
        with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army.
        Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded
        or incorporated into the People''s Liberation Army.</p>\n<p>Today, the Republic
        of China maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as
        defence against the constant threat of invasion by the PRC under the Anti-Secession
        Law of the People''s Republic of China. From 1949 to the 1970s, the primary
        mission of the military was to \"retake the mainland\" through Project National
        Glory. As this mission has shifted to defence, the ROC military has begun
        to shift emphasis from the traditionally dominant Army to the air force and
        navy.</p>\n<p>Control of the armed forces has also passed into the hands of
        the civilian government. As the ROC military shares historical roots with
        the KMT, the older generation of high-ranking officers tends to have Pan-Blue
        sympathies. However, many have retired and there are many more non-mainlanders
        enlisting in the armed forces in the younger generations, so the political
        leanings of the military have moved closer to the public norm in Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The
        ROC began a force reduction program, Jingshi An (translated to streamlining
        program), to scale down its military from a level of 450,000 in 1997 to 380,000
        in 2001. As of 2009, the armed forces of the ROC number approximately 300,000,
        with nominal reserves totalling 3.6\u00a0million as of 2005. Conscription
        remains universal for qualified males reaching age eighteen, but as a part
        of the reduction effort many are given the opportunity to fulfill their draft
        requirement through alternative service and are redirected to government agencies
        or defence related industries. Current plans call for a transition to a predominantly
        professional army over the next decade. Conscription periods are planned to
        decrease from 14\u00a0months to 12. In the last months of the Bush administration,
        Taipei took the decision to reverse the trend of declining defence spending,
        at a time when most Asian countries kept on reducing their military expenditures.
        It also decided to modernize both defensive and offensive capabilities. Taipei
        still keeps a large military apparatus relative to the island''s population:
        defence expenditures for 2008 were NTD 334 billion (approximately US $10.5
        billion), which accounted for 2.94% of GDP.</p>\n\n\n<p>The armed forces''
        primary concern at this time, according to the <i>National Defense Report</i>,
        is the possibility of an invasion by the PRC, consisting of a naval blockade,
        airborne assault, and/or missile bombardment. Four upgraded <i>Kidd</i>-class
        destroyers were purchased from the United States, and commissioned into the
        Republic of China Navy in 2005\u20132006, significantly upgrading Taiwan''s
        air defence and submarine hunting abilities. The Ministry of National Defense
        planned to purchase diesel-powered submarines and Patriot anti-missile batteries
        from the United States, but its budget has been stalled repeatedly by the
        opposition-Pan-Blue Coalition controlled legislature. The defence package
        was stalled from 2001 to 2007 where it was finally passed through the legislature
        and the US responded on 3 October 2008, with a $6.5\u00a0billion arms package
        including PAC III Anti-Air defence systems, AH-64D Apache Attack helicopters
        and other arms and parts. A significant amount of military hardware has been
        bought from the United States, and, as of 2009, continues to be legally guaranteed
        by the Taiwan Relations Act. In the past, France and the Netherlands have
        also sold military weapons and hardware to the ROC, but they almost entirely
        stopped in the 1990s under pressure of the PRC.</p>\n<p>The first line of
        defence against invasion by the PRC is the ROC''s own armed forces. Current
        ROC military doctrine is to hold out against an invasion or blockade until
        the US military responds. There is, however, no guarantee in the Taiwan Relations
        Act or any other treaty that the United States will defend Taiwan, even in
        the event of invasion. The joint declaration on security between the US and
        Japan signed in 1996 may imply that Japan would be involved in any response.
        However, Japan has refused to stipulate whether the \"area surrounding Japan\"
        mentioned in the pact includes Taiwan, and the precise purpose of the pact
        is unclear. The Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS
        Treaty) may mean that other US allies, such as Australia, could theoretically
        be involved. In practice, the risk of losing economic ties with China may
        prevent Australia from taking action. The United States, United Kingdom, Japan,
        South Korea, Australia, Canada, Chile, and Peru conduct maritime exercises
        in the Pacific Ocean every two years called RIMPAC. They are conducted to
        promote stability and to be able to respond in case of an armed conflict in
        the region \u2013 that includes an invasion of Taiwan by China.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Administrative_divisions\">Administrative divisions</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According
        to the 1947 constitution, the territory of the ROC is according to its \"existing
        national boundaries\". According to the Executive Yuan in 2012, Mongolia was
        re-recognized by Republic of China as an independent country when the constitution
        was announced in 1946.</p>\n<p>When the ROC retreated to Taiwan in 1949, its
        claimed territory consisted of 35 provinces, 12 special municipalities, 1
        special administrative region and 2 autonomous regions. However, since its
        retreat, the ROC has controlled only Taiwan Province and some islands of Fujian
        Province. The ROC also controls the Pratas Islands and Taiping Island in the
        Spratly Islands, which are part of the disputed South China Sea Islands. They
        were placed under Kaohsiung administration after the retreat to Taiwan.</p>\n<p>Since
        1949, the government has made some changes in the area under its control.
        Taipei became a special municipality in 1967 and Kaohsiung in 1979. The two
        provincial governments were \"streamlined\", with their functions transferred
        to the central government (Fujian in 1956 and Taiwan in 1998). In 2010, New
        Taipei, Taichung and Tainan were upgraded to special municipalities. And in
        2014, Taoyuan County was also upgraded to Taoyuan special municipality. This
        brought the top-level divisions to their current state:</p>\n<p>According
        to Article 4 of the Local Government Act, laws pertaining to special municipalities
        also apply to counties with a population exceeding 2 million. This provision
        does not currently apply to any county, although it previously applied to
        Taipei County (now New Taipei City) and Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City).</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Economy_and_industry\">Economy and industry</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The quick
        industrialization and rapid growth of Taiwan during the latter half of the
        20th century has been called the \"Taiwan Miracle\". Taiwan is one of the
        \"Four Asian Tigers\" alongside Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.</p>\n<p>Japanese
        rule prior to and during World War II brought changes in the public and private
        sectors, most notably in the area of public works, which enabled rapid communications
        and facilitated transport throughout much of the island. The Japanese also
        improved public education and made it compulsory for all residents of Taiwan.</p>\n<p>By
        1945, hyperinflation was in progress in mainland China and Taiwan as a result
        of the war with Japan. To isolate Taiwan from it, the Nationalist government
        created a new currency area for the island, and began a price stabilization
        program. These efforts significantly slowed inflation.</p>\n<p>When the KMT
        government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of taels (where 1\u00a0tael
        ~1.2\u00a0ozt) of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China,
        which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.
        Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought
        the intellectual and business elites from Mainland China. The KMT government
        instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted
        on mainland China. The government also implemented a policy of import-substitution,
        attempting to produce imported goods domestically.</p>\n<p>In 1950, with the
        outbreak of the Korean War, the United States began an aid program which resulted
        in fully stabilized prices by 1952. Economic development was encouraged by
        American economic aid and programs such as the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction,
        which turned the agricultural sector into the basis for later growth. Under
        the combined stimulus of the land reform and the agricultural development
        programs, agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 4
        per cent from 1952 to 1959, which was greater than the population growth,
        3.6%.</p>\n<p>In 1962, Taiwan had a (nominal) per-capita gross national product
        (GNP) of $170, placing its economy on a par with those of the Democratic Republic
        of the Congo. On a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, its GDP per capita
        in the early 1960s was $1,353 (in 1990 prices). By 2011 per-capita GNP, adjusted
        for purchasing power parity (PPP), had risen to $37,000, contributing to a
        Human Development Index (HDI) equivalent to that of other developed countries.
        Taiwan''s HDI in 2012 is 0.890, (23rd, very high), according to the UN''s
        new \"Inequality-adjusted HDI\" calculation method.</p>\n<p>In 1974, Chiang
        Ching-kuo implemented the Ten Major Construction Projects, the beginning foundations
        that helped Taiwan transform into its current export driven economy. Since
        the 1990s, a number of Taiwan-based technology firms have expanded their reach
        around the world. Well-known international technology companies headquartered
        in Taiwan include personal computer manufacturers Acer Inc. and Asus, mobile
        phone maker HTC, as well as electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn, which
        makes products for Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Computex Taipei is a major
        computer expo, held since 1981.</p>\n\n<p>Today Taiwan has a dynamic, capitalist,
        export-driven economy with gradually decreasing state involvement in investment
        and foreign trade. In keeping with this trend, some large government-owned
        banks and industrial firms are being privatized. Real growth in GDP has averaged
        about 8% during the past three decades. Exports have provided the primary
        impetus for industrialization. The trade surplus is substantial, and foreign
        reserves are the world''s fifth largest. The Republic of China has its own
        currency, the New Taiwan dollar.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the 1990s,
        the economic ties between Taiwan and the People''s Republic of China have
        been very prolific. As of 2008, more than US$150 billion have been invested
        in the PRC by Taiwanese companies, and about 10% of the Taiwanese labour force
        works in the PRC, often to run their own businesses. Although the economy
        of Taiwan benefits from this situation, some have expressed the view that
        the island has become increasingly dependent on the Mainland Chinese economy.
        A 2008 white paper by the Department of Industrial Technology states that
        \"Taiwan should seek to maintain stable relation with China while continuing
        to protect national security, and avoiding excessive ''Sinicization'' of Taiwanese
        economy.\" Others argue that close economic ties between Taiwan and Mainland
        China would make any military intervention by the PLA against Taiwan very
        costly, and therefore less probable.</p>\n<p>Taiwan''s total trade in 2010
        reached an all-time high of US$526.04 billion, according to Taiwan''s Ministry
        of Finance. Both exports and imports for the year reached record levels, totalling
        US$274.64 billion and US$251.4 billion, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, agriculture
        constituted only 2% of GDP, down from 35% in 1952. Traditional labour-intensive
        industries are steadily being moved offshore and with more capital and technology-intensive
        industries replacing them. High-technology industrial parks have sprung up
        in every region in Taiwan. The ROC has become a major foreign investor in
        the PRC, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. It is
        estimated that some 50,000\u00a0Taiwanese businesses and 1,000,000\u00a0businesspeople
        and their dependents are established in the PRC.</p>\n<p>Because of its conservative
        financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little
        compared with many of its neighbours from the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
        Unlike its neighbours, South Korea and Japan, the Taiwanese economy is dominated
        by small and medium-sized businesses, rather than the large business groups.
        The global economic downturn, however, combined with poor policy co-ordination
        by the new administration and increasing bad debts in the banking system,
        pushed Taiwan into recession in 2001, the first whole year of negative growth
        since 1947. Due to the relocation of many manufacturing and labour-intensive
        industries to the PRC, unemployment also reached a level not seen since the
        1970s oil crisis. This became a major issue in the 2004 presidential election.
        Growth averaged more than 4% in the 2002\u20132006 period and the unemployment
        rate fell below 4%.</p>\n<p>The ROC often joins international organizations
        (especially ones that also include the People''s Republic of China) under
        a politically neutral name. The ROC has been a member of governmental trade
        organizations such as the World Trade Organization under the name Separate
        Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei) since
        2002.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Transportation\">Transportation</span></h2>\n\n<p>The
        Ministry of Transportation and Communications of the Republic of China is
        the cabinet-level governing body of the transportation network in Taiwan.
        Taiwan has an extensive highway network, classified into five levels: national
        highways, provincial highways, county routes, township routes, and special
        routes, with the first four being common. Taiwan also has an extensive bus
        network, most of which are run by private bus companies. Inter-city rail services
        are provided by Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) and Taiwan High Speed
        Rail (THSR). Rapid transit systems include the Taipei Metro, Taoyuan Metro
        (incl. the Airport MRT) and Kaohsiung MRT, while Taichung Metro is under construction.
        Major airports include Taiwan Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, Taipei Songshan and Taichung.
        There are currently seven airlines in Taiwan, the largest ones being China
        Airlines and EVA Air. There are four international seaports: Keelung, Kaohsiung,
        Taichung, and Hualien.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Education,_research,_and_academia\"></span><span
        id=\"Education.2C_research.2C_and_academia\">Education, research, and academia</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The
        higher education system was established in Taiwan by Japan during the colonial
        period. However, after the Republic of China took over Taiwan from Japan in
        1945, the system was promptly replaced by the same system as in mainland China
        which mixed with features of the Chinese and American educational systems.</p>\n<p>Taiwan
        is well known for adhering to the Confucian paradigm of valuing education
        as a means to improve one''s socioeconomic position in Taiwanese society.
        Heavy investment and a cultural value for education has catapulted the resource
        poor nation consistently atop the global education rankings. Taiwan is one
        of the top-performing countries in reading literacy, maths and sciences. In
        2015, Taiwanese students achieved one of the world''s best results in mathematics,
        science and literacy, as tested by the Programme for International Student
        Assessment (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils'' scholastic
        performance. The strong scholastic and educational performance of Taiwanese
        students has prompted the nation to build a highly educated labour force that
        possesses a strong background in mathematics and science to cope with the
        current labor market demands of the 21st century.</p>\n<p>The Taiwanese education
        system has been praised for various reasons including its comparatively high
        test results and its major role in ushering Taiwan''s economic development
        while creating one of the world\u2019s most highly educated workforces. The
        country has also been praised for its high university entrance rate where
        the university acceptance rate has increased from around 20 percent before
        the 1970s to 49 percent in 1996 and over 90 percent since 2006, among the
        highest in Asia. The nation''s high university entrance rate has created a
        highly skilled workforce making Taiwan one of the most highly educated countries
        in the world with 68.5% of Taiwanese high school students going on to attend
        university. Taiwan has a high percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary
        education degree where 45 percent of Taiwanese aged 25\u201364 hold a bachelors
        degree or higher compared with the average of 33 percent among member countries
        of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). On the
        other hand, the system has been criticized for placing excessive pressure
        on students and eschewing creativity in favor of rote memorization. In addition,
        the system has been criticized for producing an excess supply of over-educated
        university graduates and a higher unemployment rate. With a large supply of
        university graduates seeking a limited demand of prestigious white collar
        jobs in an environment that is increasingly losing its competitive edge has
        led many degree holders ending up with lower end jobs with salaries far beneath
        than their expectations. Taiwan\u2019s universities have also been under criticism
        for not being able to fully meet the requirements and demands of Taiwan\u2019s
        21st century fast-moving job market citing a skills mismatch among a large
        number of self-assessed overeducated university graduates that don''t fit
        the demands of the modern Taiwanese labor market. The Taiwanese government
        has also been criticized for undermining the economy as it has been unable
        to produce enough jobs to meet the demands of numerous underemployed university
        graduates.</p>\n<p>As the Taiwanese economy is largely science and technology
        based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher
        education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain
        a competitive edge when searching for employment. Although current Taiwanese
        law mandates only nine years of schooling, 95% of junior high graduates go
        on to attend a senior vocational high school, university, junior college,
        trade school, or other higher education institution.</p>\n<p>Many Taiwanese
        students attend cram schools, or bushiban, to improve skills and knowledge
        on problem solving against exams of subjects like mathematics, nature science,
        history and many others. Courses are available for most popular subjects.
        Lessons are organized in lectures, reviews, private tutorial sessions, and
        recitations.</p>\n<p>As of 2013, the literacy rate in Taiwan is 97.15%.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Demographics\">Demographics</span></h2>\n\n<p>Taiwan''s population is
        about 23.4 million, most of whom are on the island proper. The remainder live
        on Penghu (101,758), Kinmen (127,723), and Matsu (12,506).</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Ethnic_groups\">Ethnic groups</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The ROC government
        reports that over 95% of the population is Han, of which the majority includes
        descendants of early Han Chinese immigrants who arrived in Taiwan in large
        numbers starting in the 18th century. Alternatively, the ethnic groups of
        Taiwan may be roughly divided among the Hoklo (70%), the Hakka (14%), the
        Waishengren (14%), and indigenous peoples (2%).</p>\n<p>The Hoklo people are
        the largest Han subgroup (70% of the total population), whose ancestors migrated
        from the coastal southern Fujian region across the Taiwan Strait starting
        in the 17th century. The Hakka comprise about 15% of the total population,
        and descend from Han migrants to Guangdong, its surrounding areas and Taiwan.
        Additional people of Han origin include and descend from the 2 million Nationalists
        who fled to Taiwan following the communist victory on the mainland in 1949.</p>\n<p>The
        indigenous Taiwanese aborigines number about 533,600 and are divided into
        16 recognized groups. The Ami, Atayal, Bunun, Kanakanavu, Kavalan, Paiwan,
        Puyuma, Rukai, Saisiyat, Saaroa, Sakizaya, Sediq, Thao, Truku and Tsou live
        mostly in the eastern half of the island, while the Yami inhabit Orchid Island.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Languages\">Languages</span></h3>\n\n<p>Mandarin is the official national
        language and is spoken by the vast majority of the population of Taiwan. It
        has been the primary language of instruction in schools since the end of Japanese
        rule. As in Hong Kong and Macau, Traditional Chinese is used as the writing
        system in Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The 70% of the population belonging to the Hoklo
        ethnic group speak Taiwanese Hokkien (a variant of the Min Nan speech of Fujian
        province) as their mother tongue, in addition to Mandarin, and many others
        have some degree of understanding. The Hakka ethnic group (15% of the population)
        use Hakka Chinese. Most <i>waishengren</i> speak primarily Mandarin. Although
        Mandarin is the language of instruction in schools and dominates television
        and radio, non-Mandarin Chinese varieties have undergone a revival in public
        life in Taiwan, particularly since restrictions on their use were lifted in
        the 1990s.</p>\n<p>Taiwan''s indigenous languages, the Formosan languages,
        do not belong to the Chinese or Sino-Tibetan language family, but rather to
        the Austronesian language family. Their use among Taiwan''s aboriginal minority
        groups has been in decline as usage of Mandarin has risen. Of the 14 extant
        languages, five are considered moribund.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Religion\">Religion</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        Constitution of the Republic of China protects people''s freedom of religion
        and the practices of belief. There are approximately 18,718,600 religious
        followers in Taiwan as of 2005 (81.3% of total population) and 14\u201318%
        are non-religious. According to the 2005 census, of the 26 religions recognized
        by the ROC government, the five largest are: Buddhism (8,086,000 or 35.1%),
        Taoism (7,600,000 or 33%), Yiguandao (810,000 or 3.5%), Protestantism (605,000
        or 2.6%), and Roman Catholicism (298,000 or 1.3%).</p>\n<p>The CIA World Factbook
        reports that over 93% of Taiwanese are adherents of a combination of the polytheistic
        Chinese popular religion, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism; 4.5% are adherents
        of Christianity, which includes Protestants, Catholics, and other, non-denominational,
        Christian groups; and less than 2.5% are adherents of other religions. Taiwanese
        aborigines comprise a notable subgroup among professing Christians: \"...over
        64% identify as Christian... Church buildings are the most obvious markers
        of Aboriginal villages, distinguishing them from Taiwanese or Hakka villages.\"</p>\n<p>Confucianism
        is a philosophy that deals with secular moral ethics, and serves as the foundation
        of both Chinese and Taiwanese culture. The majority of Taiwanese people usually
        combine the secular moral teachings of Confucianism with whatever religions
        they are affiliated with.</p>\n<p>As of 2009, there were 14,993 temples in
        Taiwan, approximately one place of worship per 1,500 residents. 9,202 of those
        temples were dedicated to Taoism. In 2008, Taiwan had 3,262 Churches, an increase
        of 145.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Largest_cities\">Largest cities</span></h3>\n\n<p>The

        within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering
        the total metropolitan area populations (in such rankings the Taipei-Keelung
        metro area is by far the largest agglomeration).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h2><span
        id=\"Public_health\">Public health</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>Health care in Taiwan
        is managed by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI).</p>\n<p>The
        current program was implemented in 1995, and is considered to be a form of
        social insurance. The government health insurance program maintains compulsory
        insurance for citizens who are employed, impoverished, unemployed, or victims
        of natural disasters with fees that correlate to the individual and/or family
        income; it also maintains protection for non-citizens working in Taiwan. A
        standardized method of calculation applies to all persons and can optionally
        be paid by an employer or by individual contributions.</p>\n<p>BNHI insurance
        coverage requires co-payment at the time of service for most services unless
        it is a preventative health service, for low-income families, veterans, children
        under three years old, or in the case of catastrophic diseases. Low income
        households maintain 100% premium coverage by the BNHI and co-pays are reduced
        for disabled or certain elderly people.</p>\n<p>According to a recently published
        survey, out of 3,360\u00a0patients surveyed at a randomly chosen hospital,
        75.1% of the patients said they are \"very satisfied\" with the hospital service;
        20.5% said they are \"okay\" with the service. Only 4.4% of the patients said
        they are either \"not satisfied\" or \"very not satisfied\" with the service
        or care provided.</p>\n<p>Taiwan has its own Center for Disease Control, and
        during the SARS outbreak in March 2003 there were 347\u00a0confirmed cases.
        During the outbreak the Centers for Disease Control and local governments
        set up monitored stations throughout public transportation, recreational sites
        and other public areas. With full containment in July 2003, there has not
        been a case of SARS since.</p>\n<p>As of 2006, the BNHI Facility Contract
        Distribution facilities total 17,259, including:</p>\n<p>Basic coverage areas
        of the insurance include:</p>\n<p>In 2004, the infant mortality rate was 5.3
        with 15\u00a0physicians and 63\u00a0hospital beds per 10,000\u00a0people.
        The life expectancy for males was 73.5\u00a0years and 79.7\u00a0years for
        females according to the World Health Report.</p>\n<p>In July 2013, the Department
        of Health was restructured as the Ministry of Health and Welfare.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Culture\">Culture</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The cultures of Taiwan are a hybrid
        blend of various sources, incorporating elements of traditional Chinese culture,
        attributable to the historical and ancestry origin of the majority of its
        current residents, Japanese culture, traditional Confucianist beliefs, and
        increasingly Western values.</p>\n<p>After their move to Taiwan, the Kuomintang
        imposed an official interpretation of traditional Chinese culture over Taiwan.
        The government launched a program promoting Chinese calligraphy, traditional
        Chinese painting, folk art, and Chinese opera.</p>\n<p>The status of Taiwanese
        culture is debated. It is disputed whether Taiwanese culture is a regional
        form of Chinese culture or a distinct culture. Reflecting the continuing controversy
        surrounding the political status of Taiwan, politics continues to play a role
        in the conception and development of a Taiwanese cultural identity, especially
        in the prior dominant frame of a Taiwanese and Chinese dualism. In recent
        years, the concept of Taiwanese multiculturalism has been proposed as a relatively
        apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders
        and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture
        as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought
        and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan. Identity politics, along with
        the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has
        led to distinct traditions in many areas, including cuisine and music.</p>\n\n<p>One
        of Taiwan''s greatest attractions is the National Palace Museum, which houses
        more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting, and
        porcelain and is considered one of the greatest collections of Chinese art
        and objects in the world. The KMT moved this collection from the Forbidden
        City in Beijing in 1933 and part of the collection was eventually transported
        to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. The collection, estimated to be one-tenth
        of China''s cultural treasures, is so extensive that only 1% is on display
        at any time. The PRC had said that the collection was stolen and has called
        for its return, but the ROC has long defended its control of the collection
        as a necessary act to protect the pieces from destruction, especially during
        the Cultural Revolution. Relations regarding this treasure have warmed recently;
        Beijing Palace Museum Curator Zheng Xinmiao said that artefacts in both Chinese
        and Taiwanese museums are \"China''s cultural heritage jointly owned by people
        across the Taiwan Strait.\"</p>\n<p>The classical music culture in Taiwan
        is highly developed and features artists such as violinist Cho-Liang Lin,
        pianist Ching-Yun Hu, and the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society Artist
        Director Wu Han. Karaoke, drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely
        popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like
        style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms varying on the number of guests
        in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to
        form all-encompassing elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or
        businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV''s, equipped
        not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment
        counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the
        city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theatre
        room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a
        place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.</p>\n<p>Taiwan
        has a high density of 24-hour convenience stores, which, in addition to the
        usual services, provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government
        agencies such as collection of parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation
        fines, and credit card payments. They also provide a service for mailing packages.</p>\n<p>Taiwanese
        culture has also influenced other cultures. Bubble tea and milk tea are available
        in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Taiwan television
        shows are popular in Singapore, Malaysia, and other Asian countries. Taiwanese
        films have won various international awards at film festivals around the world.
        Ang Lee, a Taiwanese director, has directed critically acclaimed films such
        as: <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>; <i>Eat Drink Man Woman</i>; <i>Sense
        and Sensibility</i>; <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>; <i>Life of Pi</i>; and <i>Lust,
        Caution</i>. Other famous Taiwanese directors include Tsai Ming-Liang, Edward
        Yang, and Hou Hsiao-hsien.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sports\">Sports</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Baseball
        is Taiwan''s national sport and it is a popular spectator sport. Two of the
        most famous Taiwanese baseball pitchers are Chien-Ming Wang and Wei-Yin Chen;
        both are pitchers in Major League Baseball. Other notable players playing
        in the United States include Chin-hui Tsao who played for the Colorado Rockies
        (2003\u20132005) and the Los Angeles Dodgers (2007, 2015\u20132016), Hong-Chih
        Kuo, Fu-Te Ni, and Chin-lung Hu. The Chinese Professional Baseball League
        in Taiwan was established in 1989, and eventually absorbed the competing Taiwan
        Major League in 2003. As of 2015, the CPBL has four teams with average attendance
        over 5,000 per game.</p>\n<p>Besides baseball, basketball is Taiwan''s major
        sport. Taekwondo has also become a mature and successful sport in recent years.
        In the 2004 Olympics, Chen Shih-hsin and Chu Mu-yen won the first two gold
        medals in women''s flyweight event and men''s flyweight event, respectively.
        Subsequent taekwondo competitors such as Yang Shu-chun have strengthened Taiwan''s
        taekwondo culture.</p>\n<p>Taiwan participates in international sporting organizations
        and events under the name of \"Chinese Taipei\" due to its political status.
        In 2009, Taiwan hosted two international sporting events on the island. The
        World Games 2009 were held in Kaohsiung between 16 and 26 July 2009. Taipei
        hosted the 21st Summer Deaflympics in September of the same year. Furthermore,
        Taipei will host the Summer Universiade in 2017.</p>\n<p>Taiwan is also a
        major Asian country for Korfball. In 2008, Taiwan hosted the World Youth Korfball
        Championship and took the silver medal. In 2009, Taiwan''s korfball team won
        a bronze medal at the World Game.</p>\n<p>Yani Tseng is the most famous Taiwanese
        professional golfer currently playing on the US-based LPGA Tour. She is the
        youngest player ever, male or female, to win five major championships and
        had been ranked number 1 in the Women''s World Golf Rankings for 109 consecutive
        weeks from 2011 to 2013.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Calendar\">Calendar</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taiwan

        The latter numbers years starting from 1911, the year of the founding of the
        Republic of China. For example, 2007 was the \"96th year of the Republic\"
        (\u6c11\u570b96\u5e74), while its months and days were numbered according
        to the Gregorian calendar.</p>\n<p>Usually, year numbering may use the Gregorian
        system as well as the ROC era system. For example, 3 May 2004, may be written
        2004-05-03 or 93-05-03. The use of two different calendar systems in Taiwan
        may be confusing, in particular for foreigners. For instance, products for
        export marked using the Minguo calendar can be misunderstood as having an
        expiration date 11\u00a0years earlier than intended.</p>\n<p>Taiwan also uses
        the lunar calendar for traditional festivals such as the Chinese New Year,
        the Lantern Festival, and the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See

        officially the <b>Republic of China</b> (<b>ROC</b>), is a state in East Asia.
        Its neighbors include the People''s Republic of China to the west, Japan to
        the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous
        state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations.</p>\n<p>The
        island of Taiwan, formerly known as Formosa, was inhabited by Taiwanese aborigines
        before the 17th century, when Dutch and Spanish colonies opened the island
        to mass Han immigration. After a brief rule by the Kingdom of Tungning, the
        island was annexed by the Qing dynasty, the last dynasty of China. The Qing
        ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895 after the Sino-Japanese War. While Taiwan was
        under Japanese rule, the Republic of China (ROC) was established on the mainland
        in 1912 after the fall of the Qing dynasty. Following the Japanese surrender
        to the Allies in 1945, the ROC took control of Taiwan. However, the resumption
        of the Chinese Civil War led to the ROC''s loss of the mainland to the Communists,
        and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949. Although the ROC continued
        to claim to be the legitimate government of China, its effective jurisdiction
        has, since the loss of Hainan in 1950, been limited to Taiwan and its surrounding
        islands, with the main island making up 99% of its <i>de facto</i> territory.
        As a founding member of the United Nations, the ROC continued to represent
        China at the United Nations until 1971, when the PRC assumed China''s seat,
        causing the ROC to lose its UN membership.</p>\n<p>In the early 1960s, Taiwan
        entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialization, creating
        a stable industrial economy. In the 1980s and early 1990s, it changed from
        a one-party military dictatorship dominated by the Kuomintang to a multi-party
        democracy with a semi-presidential system. Taiwan is the 22nd-largest economy
        in the world, and its high-tech industry plays a key role in the global economy.
        It is ranked highly in terms of freedom of the press, healthcare, public education,
        economic freedom, and human development. The country benefits from a highly
        skilled workforce and is among the most highly educated countries in the world
        with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education
        degree.</p>\n<p>The PRC has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and
        asserted the ROC is no longer in legitimate existence. Under its One-China
        Policy the PRC refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes
        the ROC. Today 20 countries maintain official ties with the ROC but many other
        states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices and institutions
        that function as <i>de facto</i> embassies and consulates. Although Taiwan
        is fully self-governing, most international organizations in which the PRC
        participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate
        only as a non-state actor. Internally, the major division in politics is between
        the aspirations of eventual Chinese unification or Taiwanese independence,
        though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal.
        The PRC has threatened the use of military force in response to any formal
        declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful
        unification is no longer possible.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n\n<p>There
        are various names for the island of Taiwan in use today, derived from explorers
        or rulers by each particular period. The former name Formosa (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u798f\u723e\u6469\u6c99</span>)
        dates from 1542, when Portuguese sailors sighted the main island of Taiwan
        and named it <i>Ilha Formosa</i>, which means \"beautiful island\". The name
        \"Formosa\" eventually \"replaced all others in European literature\" and
        was in common use in English in the early 20th century.</p>\n<p>In the early
        17th century, the Dutch East India Company established a commercial post at
        Fort Zeelandia (modern-day Anping, Tainan) on a coastal sandbar called \"Tayouan\",
        after their ethnonym for a nearby Taiwanese aboriginal tribe, written by the
        Dutch and Portuguese variously as <i>Taiouwang</i>, <i>Tayowan</i>, <i>Teijoan</i>,
        etc. This name was also adopted into the Chinese vernacular (in particular,
        Hokkien, as Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: <i><span lang=\"nan\">T\u0101i-o\u00e2n/T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n</span></i>)
        as the name of the sandbar and nearby area (Tainan). The modern word \"Taiwan\"
        is derived from this usage, which is seen in various forms (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u5927\u54e1,
        \u5927\u5713, \u5927\u7063, \u81fa\u54e1, \u81fa\u5713</span> and <span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u81fa\u7aa9\u7063</span>)
        in Chinese historical records. The area of modern-day Tainan was the first
        permanent settlement by Western colonists and Chinese immigrants, grew to
        be the most important trading centre, and served as the capital of the island
        until 1887. Use of the current Chinese name (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u81fa\u7063</span>)
        was formalized as early as 1684 with the establishment of Taiwan Prefecture.
        Through its rapid development, the entire Formosan mainland eventually became
        known as \"Taiwan\".</p>\n<p>In his <i>Daoyi Zhil\u00fce</i> (1349), Wang
        Dayuan used \"Liuqiu\" as a name for the island of Taiwan, or the part of
        it near to Penghu. Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in
        general or Okinawa, the largest of them; indeed the name <i>Ry\u016bky\u016b</i>
        is the Japanese form of <i>Li\u00faqi\u00fa</i>. The name also appears in
        the <i>Book of Sui</i> (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree
        on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even Luzon.</p>\n<p>The
        official name of the state is the \"Republic of China\"; it has also been
        known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC''s
        establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland,
        the government used the short form \"China\" <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3</span></i>
        <span>(<span lang=\"zh\">\u4e2d\u570b</span>),</span> to refer to itself,
        which derives from <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">zh\u014dng</span></i>
        (\"central\" or \"middle\") and <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">gu\u00f3</span></i>
        (\"state, nation-state\"),  A term which also developed under the Zhou Dynasty
        in reference to its royal demesne and the name was then applied to the area
        around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China''s
        Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under
        the Qingera . During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had fled to
        Taiwan due to losing the Chinese Civil War, it was commonly referred to as
        \"<b>Nationalist China</b>\" (or \"Free China\") to differentiate it from
        \"Communist China\" (or \"Red China\"). It was a member of the United Nations
        representing \"<i>China</i>\" until 1971, when it lost its seat to the People''s
        Republic of China. Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become
        commonly known as \"Taiwan\", after the island that comprises 99% of the territory
        under its control. In some contexts, especially official ones from the ROC
        government, the name is written as \"Republic of China (Taiwan)\", \"Republic
        of China/Taiwan\", or sometimes \"Taiwan (ROC).\" The Republic of China participates
        in most international forums and organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei\"
        due to diplomatic pressure from the People''s Republic of China. For instance,
        it is the name under which it has competed at the Olympic Games since 1984,
        and its name as an observer at the World Health Organization.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Prehistoric_Taiwan\">Prehistoric
        Taiwan</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Taiwan was joined to the mainland in the Late Pleistocene,
        until sea levels rose about 10,000 years ago. Fragmentary human remains dated
        20,000 to 30,000 years ago have been found on the island, as well as later
        artefacts of a Paleolithic culture.</p>\n<p>Around 6,000 years ago, Taiwan
        was settled by farmers, most likely from mainland China. They are believed
        to be the ancestors of today''s Taiwanese aborigines, whose languages belong
        to the Austronesian language family, but show much greater diversity than
        the rest of the family, which spans a huge area from Maritime Southeast Asia
        west to Madagascar and east as far as New Zealand, Hawaii and Easter Island.
        This has led linguists to propose Taiwan as the urheimat of the family, from
        which seafaring peoples dispersed across Southeast Asia and the Pacific and
        Indian Oceans.</p>\n<p>Han Chinese fishermen began settling in the Penghu
        islands in the 13th century. Hostile tribes, and a lack of valuable trade
        products, meant that few outsiders visited the main island until the 16th
        century. By the 1700''s visits to the coast by fishermen from Fujian, as well
        as Chinese and Japanese pirates, became more frequent.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Opening_in_the_17th_century\">Opening
        in the 17th century</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The Dutch East India Company attempted
        to establish a trading outpost on the Penghu Islands (Pescadores) in 1622,
        but were militarily defeated and driven off by the Ming authorities.</p>\n<p>In
        1624, the company established a stronghold called Fort Zeelandia on the coastal
        islet of Tayouan, which is now part of the main island at Anping, Tainan.
        David Wright, a Scottish agent of the company who lived on the island in the
        1650s, described the lowland areas of the island as being divided among 11
        chiefdoms ranging in size from two settlements to 72. Some of these fell under
        Dutch control, while others remained independent. The Company began to import
        labourers from Fujian and Penghu (Pescadores), many of whom settled.</p>\n<p>In
        1626, the Spanish Empire landed on and occupied northern Taiwan, at the ports
        of Keelung and Tamsui, as a base to extend their trading. This colonial period
        lasted 16 years until 1642, when the last Spanish fortress fell to Dutch forces.</p>\n<p>Following
        the fall of the Ming dynasty, Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), a self-styled Ming
        loyalist, arrived on the island and captured Fort Zeelandia in 1662, expelling
        the Dutch Empire and military from the island. Koxinga established the Kingdom
        of Tungning (1662\u20131683), with his capital at Tainan. He and his heirs,
        Zheng Jing, who ruled from 1662 to 1682, and Zheng Keshuang, who ruled less
        than a year, continued to launch raids on the southeast coast of mainland
        China well into the Qing dynasty era.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Qing_rule\">Qing
        rule</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>In 1683, following the defeat of Koxinga''s grandson
        by an armada led by Admiral Shi Lang of southern Fujian, the Qing dynasty
        formally annexed Taiwan, placing it under the jurisdiction of Fujian province.
        The Qing imperial government tried to reduce piracy and vagrancy in the area,
        issuing a series of edicts to manage immigration and respect aboriginal land
        rights. Immigrants mostly from southern Fujian continued to enter Taiwan.
        The border between taxpaying lands and \"savage\" lands shifted eastward,
        with some aborigines becoming sinicized while others retreated into the mountains.
        During this time, there were a number of conflicts between groups of Han Chinese
        from different regions of southern Fujian, particularly between those from
        Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, and between southern Fujian Chinese and aborigines.</p>\n<p>Northern
        Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were the scene of subsidiary campaigns in the
        Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885). The French occupied Keelung on
        1 October 1884, but were repulsed from Tamsui a few days later. The French
        won some tactical victories but were unable to exploit them, and the Keelung
        Campaign ended in stalemate. The Pescadores Campaign, beginning on 31 March
        1885, was a French victory, but had no long-term consequences. The French
        evacuated both Keelung and the Penghu archipelago after the end of the war.</p>\n<p>In
        1887, the Qing upgraded the island''s administration from Taiwan Prefecture
        of Fujian to Fujian-Taiwan-Province (\u798f\u5efa\u81fa\u7063\u7701), the
        twentieth in the empire, with its capital at Taipei. This was accompanied
        by a modernization drive that included building China''s first railroad.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Japanese_rule\">Japanese rule</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>As the Qing dynasty
        was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895), Taiwan, along
        with Penghu and Liaodong Peninsula, were ceded in full sovereignty to the
        Empire of Japan by the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Inhabitants on Taiwan and Penghu
        wishing to remain Qing subjects were given a two-year grace period to sell
        their property and move to mainland China. Very few Taiwanese saw this as
        feasible. On 25 May 1895, a group of pro-Qing high officials proclaimed the
        Republic of Formosa to resist impending Japanese rule. Japanese forces entered
        the capital at Tainan and quelled this resistance on 21 October 1895. Guerrilla
        fighting continued periodically until about 1902 and ultimately took the lives
        of 14,000 Taiwanese, or 0.5% of the population. Several subsequent rebellions
        against the Japanese (the Beipu uprising of 1907, the Tapani incident of 1915,
        and the Musha incident of 1930) were all unsuccessful but demonstrated opposition
        to Japanese colonial rule.</p>\n<p>Japanese colonial rule was instrumental
        in the industrialization of the island, extending the railroads and other
        transportation networks, building an extensive sanitation system, and establishing
        a formal education system. Japanese rule ended the practice of headhunting.
        During this period the human and natural resources of Taiwan were used to
        aid the development of Japan and the production of cash crops such as rice
        and sugar greatly increased. By 1939, Taiwan was the seventh greatest sugar
        producer in the world. Still, the Taiwanese and aborigines were classified
        as second- and third-class citizens. After suppressing Chinese guerrillas
        in the first decade of their rule, Japanese authorities engaged in a series
        of bloody campaigns against the mountain aboriginals, culminating in the Musha
        Incident of 1930. Intellectuals and laborers who participated in left-wing
        movements within Taiwan were also arrested and massacred (e.g. Tsi\u00fann
        U\u012b-Su\u00ed(\u8523\u6e2d\u6c34), Masanosuke Watanabe (\u6e21\u8fba\u653f\u4e4b\u8f85)).</p>\n<p>Around
        1935, the Japanese began an island-wide assimilation project to bind the island
        more firmly to the Japanese Empire and people were taught to see themselves
        as Japanese under the Kominka Movement, during which time Taiwanese culture
        and religion were outlawed and the citizens were encouraged to adopt Japanese
        surnames. The \"South Strike Group\" was based at the Taihoku Imperial University
        in Taipei. During World War II, tens of thousands of Taiwanese served in the
        Japanese military. For example, former ROC President Lee Teng-hui''s elder
        brother served in the Japanese navy and was killed in action in the Philippines
        in February 1945. The Imperial Japanese Navy operated heavily out of Taiwanese
        ports. In October 1944, the Formosa Air Battle was fought between American
        carriers and Japanese forces based in Taiwan. Important Japanese military
        bases and industrial centres throughout Taiwan, like Kaohsiung, were targets
        of heavy American bombings. Also during this time, over 2,000 women were forced
        into sexual slavery for Imperial Japanese troops, now euphemistically called
        \"comfort women.\"</p>\n<p>In 1938, there were 309,000 Japanese settlers in
        Taiwan. After World War II, most of the Japanese were expelled and sent to
        Japan.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Republic_of_China\">Republic of China</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During
        Japanese rule of Taiwan, on 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was declared
        with Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (the KMT or Nationalist Party) was proclaimed
        provisional president following the Xinhai Revolution, which itself began
        with the Wuchang Uprising on 10 October 1911, overthrowing the Qing Dynasty
        and ending over two thousand years of imperial rule in China. However, the
        presidency was later given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general who in 1915
        proclaimed himself Emperor of China. In the face of popular condemnation and
        opposition from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to abdicate and re-establish
        the republic.</p>\n<p>Since its founding until 1949 it was based on mainland
        China. Central authority waxed and waned in response to warlordism (1915\u201328)
        after Yuan Shikai''s death in 1916,, Japanese invasion (1937\u201345), and
        the Chinese Civil War (1927\u201349), with central authority strongest during
        the Nanjing Decade (1927\u201337), when most of China came under the control
        of the Kuomintang (KMT) under an authoritarian one-party state.</p>\n<p>After
        the Surrender of Japan, on 25 October 1945, the US Navy ferried ROC troops
        to Taiwan in order to accept the formal surrender of Japanese military forces
        in Taipei on behalf of the Allied Powers, as part of General Order No. 1 for
        temporary military occupation. General Rikichi And\u014d, governor-general
        of Taiwan and commander-in-chief of all Japanese forces on the island, signed
        the receipt and handed it over to General Chen Yi of the ROC military to complete
        the official turnover. Chen Yi proclaimed that day to be \"Taiwan Retrocession
        Day\", but the Allies considered Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to be under
        military occupation and still under Japanese sovereignty until 1952, when
        the Treaty of San Francisco took effect. Although the 1943 Cairo Declaration
        had envisaged returning these territories to China, in the Treaty of San Francisco
        and Treaty of Taipei Japan has renounced all claim to them without specifying
        to what country they were to be surrendered. This introduced the problem of
        the legal status of Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The ROC administration of Taiwan under
        Chen Yi was strained by increasing tensions between Taiwanese-born people
        and newly arrived mainlanders, which were compounded by economic woes, such
        as hyperinflation. Furthermore, cultural and linguistic conflicts between
        the two groups quickly led to the loss of popular support for the new government,
        while the mass movement led by the working committee of the Communist Party
        also aimed to bring down the Kuomintang government. The shooting of a civilian
        on 28 February 1947 triggered island-wide unrest, which was suppressed with
        military force in what is now called the February 28 Incident. Mainstream
        estimates of the number killed range from 18,000 to 30,000. Those killed were
        mainly members of the Taiwanese elite.</p>\n\n<p>After the end of World War
        II, the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Chinese Nationalists (Kuomintang),
        led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong.
        Throughout the months of 1949, a series of Chinese Communist offensives led
        to the capture of its capital Nanjing on 23 April and the subsequent defeat
        of the Nationalist army on the mainland, and the Communists founded the People''s
        Republic of China on 1 October.</p>\n<p>On 7 December 1949, after the loss
        of four capitals, Chiang evacuated his Nationalist government to Taiwan and
        made Taipei the temporary capital of the ROC (also called the \"wartime capital\"
        by Chiang Kai-shek). Some 2 million people, consisting mainly of soldiers,
        members of the ruling Kuomintang and intellectual and business elites, were
        evacuated from mainland China to Taiwan at that time, adding to the earlier
        population of approximately six million. In addition, the ROC government took
        to Taipei many national treasures and much of China''s gold reserves and foreign
        currency reserves.</p>\n<p>After losing most of the mainland, the Kuomintang
        held remaining control of Tibet, the portions of Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Yunnan
        provinces along with the Hainan Island until 1951 before the Communists subsequently
        captured both territories. From this point onwards, the Kuomintang''s territory
        was reduced to Taiwan, Penghu, the portions of the Fujian province (Kinmen
        and Matsu Islands), and two major islands of Dongsha Islands and Nansha Islands.
        The Kuomintang continued to claim sovereignty over all \"China\", which it
        defined to include mainland China, Taiwan, Outer Mongolia and other areas.
        On mainland China, the victorious Communists claimed they ruled the sole and
        only China (which they claimed included Taiwan) and that the Republic of China
        no longer existed.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"Chinese_Nationalist_one-party_rule\">Chinese
        Nationalist one-party rule</span></h4>\n<p>Martial law, declared on Taiwan
        in May 1949, continued to be in effect after the central government relocated
        to Taiwan. It was not repealed until 1987, and was used as a way to suppress
        the political opposition in the intervening years. During the White Terror,
        as the period is known, 140,000 people were imprisoned or executed for being
        perceived as anti-KMT or pro-Communist. Many citizens were arrested, tortured,
        imprisoned and executed for their real or perceived link to the Communists.
        Since these people were mainly from the intellectual and social elite, an
        entire generation of political and social leaders was decimated. In 1998 law
        was passed to create the \"Compensation Foundation for Improper Verdicts\"
        which oversaw compensation to White Terror victims and families. President
        Ma Ying-jeou made an official apology in 2008, expressing hope that there
        will never be a tragedy similar to White Terror.</p>\n<p>Initially, the United
        States abandoned the KMT and expected that Taiwan would fall to the Communists.
        However, in 1950 the conflict between North Korea and South Korea, which had
        been ongoing since the Japanese withdrawal in 1945, escalated into full-blown
        war, and in the context of the Cold War, US President Harry S. Truman intervened
        again and dispatched the US Navy''s 7th Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent
        hostilities between Taiwan and mainland China. In the Treaty of San Francisco
        and the Treaty of Taipei, which came into force respectively on 28 April 1952
        and 5 August 1952, Japan formally renounced all right, claim and title to
        Taiwan and Penghu, and renounced all treaties signed with China before 1942.
        Neither treaty specified to whom sovereignty over the islands should be transferred,
        because the United States and the United Kingdom disagreed on whether the
        ROC or the PRC was the legitimate government of China. Continuing conflict
        of the Chinese Civil War through the 1950s, and intervention by the United
        States notably resulted in legislation such as the Sino-American Mutual Defense
        Treaty and the Formosa Resolution of 1955.</p>\n\n<p>As the Chinese Civil
        War continued without truce, the government built up military fortifications
        throughout Taiwan. Within this effort, KMT veterans built the now famous Central
        Cross-Island Highway through the Taroko Gorge in the 1950s. The two sides
        would continue to engage in sporadic military clashes with seldom publicized
        details well into the 1960s on the China coastal islands with an unknown number
        of night raids. During the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in September 1958,
        Taiwan''s landscape saw Nike-Hercules missile batteries added, with the formation
        of the 1st Missile Battalion Chinese Army that would not be deactivated until
        1997. Newer generations of missile batteries have since replaced the Nike
        Hercules systems throughout the island.</p>\n<p>During the 1960s and 1970s,
        the ROC maintained an authoritarian, single-party government while its economy
        became industrialized and technology oriented. This rapid economic growth,
        known as the Taiwan Miracle, was the result of a fiscal regime independent
        from mainland China and backed up, among others, by the support of US funds
        and demand for Taiwanese products. In the 1970s, Taiwan was economically the
        second fastest growing state in Asia after Japan. Taiwan, along with Hong
        Kong, South Korea and Singapore, became known as one of the Four Asian Tigers.
        Because of the Cold War, most Western nations and the United Nations regarded
        the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China until the 1970s. Later,
        especially after the termination of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty,
        most nations switched diplomatic recognition to the PRC (see United Nations
        General Assembly Resolution 2758).</p>\n<p>Up until the 1970s, the government
        was regarded by Western critics as undemocratic for upholding martial law,
        for severely repressing any political opposition and for controlling media.
        The KMT did not allow the creation of new parties and those that existed did
        not seriously compete with the KMT. Thus, competitive democratic elections
        did not exist. From the late 1970s to the 1990s, however, Taiwan went through
        reforms and social changes that transformed it from an authoritarian state
        to a democracy. In 1979, a pro-democracy protest known as the Kaohsiung Incident
        took place in Kaohsiung to celebrate Human Rights Day. Although the protest
        was rapidly crushed by the authorities, it is today considered as the main
        event that united Taiwan''s opposition.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Democratization\">Democratization</span></h4>\n\n<p>Chiang
        Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek''s son and successor as the president, began to
        liberalize the political system in the mid-1980s. In 1984, the younger Chiang
        selected Lee Teng-hui, a Taiwanese-born, US-educated technocrat, to be his
        vice-president. In 1986, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was formed
        and inaugurated as the first opposition party in the ROC to counter the KMT.
        A year later, Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law on the main island of Taiwan
        (martial law was lifted on Penghu in 1979, Matsu island in 1992 and Kinmen
        island in 1993). With the advent of democratization, the issue of the political
        status of Taiwan gradually resurfaced as a controversial issue where, previously,
        the discussion of anything other than unification under the ROC was taboo.</p>\n<p>After
        the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, Lee Teng-hui succeeded him
        as president. Lee continued to democratize the government and decrease the
        concentration of government authority in the hands of mainland Chinese. Under
        Lee, Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which Taiwanese culture
        and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint in contrast to earlier
        KMT policies which had promoted a Chinese identity. Lee''s reforms included
        printing banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of
        Taiwan, and streamlining the Taiwan Provincial Government with most of its
        functions transferred to the Executive Yuan. Under Lee, the original members
        of the Legislative Yuan and National Assembly(a former supreme legislative
        body defunct in 2005\uff09, elected in 1947 to represent mainland Chinese
        constituencies and having held the seats without re-election for more than
        four decades, were forced to resign in 1991. The previously nominal representation
        in the Legislative Yuan was brought to an end, reflecting the reality that
        the ROC had no jurisdiction over mainland China, and vice versa. Restrictions
        on the use of Taiwanese Hokkien in the broadcast media and in schools were
        also lifted.</p>\n\n<p>Democratic reforms continued in the 1990s, with Lee
        Teng-hui re-elected in 1996, in the first direct presidential election in
        the history of the ROC. During the later years of Lee''s administration, he
        was involved in corruption controversies relating to government release of
        land and weapons purchase, although no legal proceedings commenced. In 1997,\"To
        meet the requisites of the nation prior to national unification\", the Additional
        Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China was passed and then
        the former \"constitution of five powers\" turns to be more tripartite. In
        2000, Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party was elected as the
        first non-Kuomintang (KMT) President and was re-elected to serve his second
        and last term since 2004. Polarized politics has emerged in Taiwan with the
        formation of the Pan-Blue Coalition of parties led by the KMT, favouring eventual
        Chinese reunification, and the Pan-Green Coalition of parties led by the DPP,
        favouring an eventual and official declaration of Taiwanese independence.
        In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian remarked: \u201cThe National Unification
        Council will cease to function. No budget will be ear-marked for it and its
        personnel must return to their original posts...The National Unification Guidelines
        will cease to apply.\"</p>\n\n<p>On 30 September 2007, the ruling DPP approved
        a resolution asserting a separate identity from China and called for the enactment
        of a new constitution for a \"normal country\". It also called for general
        use of \"Taiwan\" as the country''s name, without abolishing its formal name,
        the Republic of China. The Chen administration also pushed for referendums
        on national defence and UN entry in the 2004 and 2008 elections, which failed
        due to voter turnout below the required legal threshold of 50% of all registered
        voters. The Chen administration was dogged by public concerns over reduced
        economic growth, legislative gridlock due to a pan-blue, opposition-controlled
        Legislative Yuan and corruption involving the First Family as well as government
        officials.</p>\n<p>The KMT increased its majority in the Legislative Yuan
        in the January 2008 legislative elections, while its nominee Ma Ying-jeou
        went on to win the presidency in March of the same year, campaigning on a
        platform of increased economic growth and better ties with the PRC under a
        policy of \"mutual nondenial\". Ma took office on 20 May 2008, the same day
        that President Chen Shui-bian stepped down and was notified by prosecutors
        of possible corruption charges. Part of the rationale for campaigning for
        closer economic ties with the PRC stems from the strong economic growth China
        attained since joining the World Trade Organization. However, some analysts
        say that despite the election of Ma Ying-jeou, the diplomatic and military
        tensions with the PRC have not been reduced.</p>\n<p>On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional
        Court ruled that current marriage laws are unconstitutional and that same-sex
        couples in the Taiwanese LGBT community should have the right to marry. The
        court has given the Legislative Yuan two years to adequately amend Taiwanese
        marriage laws. According to the court ruling, if amendments are not passed
        within two years, same-sex marriages will automatically become legal in Taiwan.</p>\n<h2><span

        (13,855\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and lies some 180 kilometres (110\u00a0mi) from
        the southeastern coast of mainland China across the Taiwan Strait. The East
        China Sea lies to the north, the Philippine Sea to the east, the Bashi Channel
        of the Luzon Strait directly to the south, and the South China Sea to the
        southwest. Its shape is similar to a sweet potato, giving rise to the name
        <i>sweet potato</i> used by Taiwanese Hokkien speakers for people of Taiwanese
        descent.</p>\n<p>The island is characterized by the contrast between the eastern
        two-thirds, consisting mostly of rugged mountains running in five ranges from
        the northern to the southern tip of the island, and the flat to gently rolling
        Chianan Plains in the west that are also home to most of Taiwan''s population.
        Taiwan''s highest point is Yu Shan (Jade Mountain) at 3,952 metres (12,966\u00a0ft),
        making Taiwan the world''s fourth-highest island.</p>\n<p>The Penghu Islands,
        50\u00a0km (31.1\u00a0mi) west of the main island, have an area of 126.9\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>
        (49.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). More distant islands controlled by the Republic of

        lies on the Tropic of Cancer, and its general climate is marine tropical.
        The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical
        and the mountainous regions are temperate. The average rainfall is 2,600 millimetres
        (100 inches) per year for the island proper; the rainy season is concurrent
        with the onset of the summer East Asian Monsoon in May and June. The entire
        island experiences hot, humid weather from June through September. Typhoons
        are most common in July, August and September. During the winter (November
        to March), the northeast experiences steady rain, while the central and southern
        parts of the island are mostly sunny.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Geology\">Geology</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        island of Taiwan lies in a complex tectonic area between the Yangtze Plate
        to the west and north, the Okinawa Plate on the north-east, and the Philippine
        Mobile Belt on the east and south. The upper part of the crust on the island
        is primarily made up of a series of terranes, mostly old island arcs which
        have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the Eurasian
        Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. These have been further uplifted as a
        result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was subducted
        beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust
        under Taiwan more buoyant.</p>\n<p>The east and south of Taiwan are a complex
        system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between
        the North Luzon Trough portion of the Luzon Volcanic Arc and South China,
        where accreted portions of the Luzon Arc and Luzon forearc form the eastern
        Coastal Range and parallel inland Longitudinal Valley of Taiwan respectively.</p>\n<p>The
        major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between
        the various terranes. These have produced major quakes throughout the history
        of the island. On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the \"921 earthquake\"
        killed more than 2,400 people. The seismic hazard map for Taiwan by the USGS
        shows 9/10 of the island as the highest rating (most hazardous).</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Political_and_legal_status\">Political and legal status</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The
        political and legal statuses of Taiwan are contentious issues. The People''s
        Republic of China (PRC) claims that the Republic of China government is illegitimate,
        referring to it as the \"Taiwan Authority\" even though current ROC territories
        have never been controlled by the PRC. The ROC has its own constitution, independently
        elected president and armed forces. It has not formally renounced its claim
        to the mainland, but ROC government publications have increasingly downplayed
        it.</p>\n<p>Internationally, there is controversy on whether the ROC still
        exists as a state or a defunct state per international law due to the lack
        of wide diplomatic recognition. In a poll of Taiwanese aged 20 and older taken
        by TVBS in March 2009, a majority of 64% opted for the \"status quo\", while
        19% favoured \"independence\" and 5% favoured \"unification\".</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Relations_with_the_PRC\">Relations with the PRC</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        political environment is complicated by the potential for military conflict
        should Taiwan declare de jure independence; it is the official PRC policy
        to use force to ensure unification if peaceful unification is no longer possible,
        as stated in its anti-secession law, and for this reason there are substantial
        military installations on the Fujian coast.</p>\n<p>On 29 April 2005, Kuomintang
        Chairman Lien Chan travelled to Beijing and met with Communist Party of China
        (CPC) Secretary-General Hu Jintao, the first meeting between the leaders of
        the two parties since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. On 11 February
        2014, Mainland Affairs Council Head Wang Yu-chi travelled to Nanjing and met
        with Taiwan Affairs Office Head Zhang Zhijun, the first meeting between high-ranking
        officials from either side. Zhang paid a reciprocal visit to Taiwan and met
        Wang on 25 June 2014, making Zhang the first minister-level PRC official to
        ever visit Taiwan. On 7 November 2015, Ma Ying-jeou (in his capacity as <i>Leader
        of Taiwan</i>) and Xi Jinping (in his capacity as <i>Leader of Mainland China</i>)
        travelled to Singapore and met up, marking the highest-level exchange between
        the two sides since 1949.</p>\n<p>The PRC supports a version of the One-China
        policy, which states that Taiwan and mainland China are both part of China,
        and that the PRC is the only legitimate government of China. It uses this
        policy to prevent the international recognition of the ROC as an independent
        sovereign state, meaning that Taiwan participates in international forums
        under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". With the emergence of the Taiwanese independence
        movement, the name \"Taiwan\" has been employed increasingly often on the
        island.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Foreign_relations\">Foreign relations</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before
        1928, the foreign policy of Republican China was complicated by a lack of
        internal unity\u2014competing centres of power all claimed legitimacy. This
        situation changed after the defeat of the Peiyang Government by the Kuomintang,
        which led to widespread diplomatic recognition of the Republic of China.</p>\n<p>After
        the KMT''s retreat to Taiwan, most countries, notably the countries in the
        Western Bloc, continued to maintain relations with the ROC. Due to diplomatic
        pressure, recognition gradually eroded and many countries switched recognition
        to the PRC in the 1970s. UN Resolution 2758 (25 October 1971) recognized the
        People''s Republic of China as China''s sole representative in the United
        Nations.</p>\n<p>The PRC refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation
        that recognizes the ROC, and requires all nations with which it has diplomatic
        relations to make a statement recognizing its claims to Taiwan. As a result,
        only 19\u00a0UN member states and the Holy See maintain official diplomatic
        relations with the Republic of China. The ROC maintains unofficial relations
        with most countries via <i>de facto</i> embassies and consulates called Taipei
        Economic and Cultural Representative Offices (TECRO), with branch offices
        called \"Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices\" (TECO). Both TECRO and TECO
        are \"unofficial commercial entities\" of the ROC in charge of maintaining
        diplomatic relations, providing consular services (i.e. visa applications),
        and serving the national interests of the ROC in other countries.</p>\n<p>The
        United States remains one of the main allies of the country and, through the
        Taiwan Relations Act passed in 1979, has continued selling arms and providing
        military training to the Armed Forces. This situation continues to be an issue
        for the People''s Republic of China which considers US involvement disruptive
        to the stability of the region. In January 2010, the Obama administration
        announced its intention to sell $6.4 billion worth of military hardware to
        Taiwan. As a consequence, the PRC threatened the US with economic sanctions
        and warned that their co-operation on international and regional issues could
        suffer.</p>\n<p>The official position of the United States is that the PRC
        is expected to \"use no force or threat[en] to use force against Taiwan\"
        and the ROC is to \"exercise prudence in managing all aspects of Cross-Strait
        relations.\" Both are to refrain from performing actions or espousing statements
        \"that would unilaterally alter Taiwan''s status.\"</p>\n<p>On 16 December
        2015, the Obama administration announced a deal to sell $1.83 billion worth
        of arms to the armed forces of the ROC. China''s foreign ministry had expressed
        its disapproval for the sales and issued the US a \"stern warning\", saying
        it would hurt China\u2013US relations.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Participation_in_international_events_and_organizations\">Participation
        in international events and organizations</span></h3>\n\n<p>The ROC was a
        founding member of the United Nations, and held the seat of China on the Security
        Council and other UN bodies until 1971, when it was expelled by Resolution
        2758 and replaced in all UN organs with the PRC. Each year since 1992, the
        ROC has petitioned the UN for entry, but its applications have not made it
        past committee.</p>\n\n<p>Due to its limited international recognition, the
        Republic of China is a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization,
        represented by a government-funded organization, the Taiwan Foundation for
        Democracy (TFD) under the name \"Taiwan\".</p>\n<p>Also due to its One China
        policy, the PRC only participates in international organizations where the
        ROC is not recognized as a sovereign country. Most member states, including
        the United States, do not wish to discuss the issue of the ROC''s political
        status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the PRC. However, both the
        US and Japan publicly support the ROC''s bid for membership in the World Health
        Organization as an observer. However, though the ROC sought to participate
        in the WHO since 1997, their efforts were blocked by the PRC until 2010, when
        they were invited as observers to attend the World Health Assembly, under
        the name \"Chinese Taipei\".</p>\n<p>Due to PRC pressure, the ROC is forced
        to use the name \"Chinese Taipei\" in international events, such as the Olympic
        Games, where the PRC is also a party. The ROC is typically barred from using
        its national anthem and national flag in international events due to PRC pressure;
        ROC spectators attending events such as the Olympics are often barred from
        bringing ROC flags into venues. Taiwan also participates in the Asia-Pacific
        Economic Cooperation forum (since 1991) and the World Trade Organization (since
        2002) under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". The ROC is able to participate as
        \"China\" in organizations that the PRC does not participate in, such as the
        World Organization of the Scout Movement.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Opinions_within_Taiwan\">Opinions
        within Taiwan</span></h3>\n\n<p>Within Taiwan, opinions are polarized between
        those supporting unification, represented by the Pan-Blue Coalition of parties,
        and those supporting independence, represented by the Pan-Green Coalition.</p>\n<p>The
        KMT, the largest Pan-Blue party, supports the status quo for the indefinite
        future with a stated ultimate goal of unification. However, it does not support
        unification in the short term with the PRC as such a prospect would be unacceptable
        to most of its members and the public. Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the KMT and
        former president of the ROC, has set out democracy, economic development to
        a level near that of Taiwan, and equitable wealth distribution as the conditions
        that the PRC must fulfill for reunification to occur.</p>\n<p>The Democratic
        Progressive Party, the largest Pan-Green party, officially seeks independence,
        but in practice also supports the status quo because its members and the public
        would not accept the risk of provoking the PRC.</p>\n<p>On 2 September 2008,
        Mexican newspaper <i>El Sol de M\u00e9xico</i> asked President Ma about his
        views on the subject of \"two Chinas\" and if there was a solution for the
        sovereignty issues between the two. The president replied that the relations
        are neither between two Chinas nor two states. It is a special relationship.
        Further, he stated that the sovereignty issues between the two cannot be resolved
        at present, but he quoted the \"1992 Consensus\", currently accepted by both
        the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China, as a temporary measure until
        a solution becomes available.</p>\n<p>On 27 September 2017, Taiwanese premier
        William Lai said that he was a \u201cpolitical worker who advocates Taiwan
        independence\u201d, but that as Taiwan was an independent country called the
        Republic of China, it had no need to declare independence. The relationship
        with the PRC and the related issues of Taiwanese independence and Chinese
        unification continue to dominate politics.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Government_and_politics\">Government
        and politics</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The government of the Republic of China
        was founded on the Constitution of the ROC and its Three Principles of the
        People, which states that the ROC \"shall be a democratic republic of the
        people, to be governed by the people and for the people.\" The government
        is divided into five branches (<i>Yuan</i>): the Executive Yuan (cabinet),
        the Legislative Yuan (Congress or Parliament), the Judicial Yuan, the Control
        Yuan (audit agency), and the Examination Yuan (civil service examination agency).
        The constitution was drafted before the fall of mainland China to the Communist
        Party of China. It was created by the KMT for the purpose of all of its claimed
        territory, including Taiwan, even though the Communist Party boycotted the
        drafting of the constitution. The constitution went into effect on 25 December
        1947. The ROC remained under martial law from 1948 until 1987 and much of
        the constitution was not in effect. Political reforms beginning in the late
        1970s and continuing through the early 1990s liberalized the country and transformed
        into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic
        of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components
        that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment
        continues. In 2000, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidency,
        ending KMT''s continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National
        Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement
        several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National
        Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of
        constitutional reform to the popular ballot.</p>\n<p>The head of state and
        commander-in-chief of the armed forces is the president, who is elected by
        popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the
        vice-president. The president has authority over the Yuan. The president appoints
        the members of the Executive Yuan as his cabinet, including a premier, who
        is officially the President of the Executive Yuan; members are responsible
        for policy and administration.</p>\n<p>The main legislative body is the unicameral
        Legislative Yuan with 113 seats. Seventy-three are elected by popular vote
        from single-member constituencies; thirty-four are elected based on the proportion
        of nationwide votes received by participating political parties in a separate
        party list ballot; and six are elected from two three-member aboriginal constituencies.
        Members serve four-year terms. Originally the unicameral National Assembly,
        as a standing constitutional convention and electoral college, held some parliamentary
        functions, but the National Assembly was abolished in 2005 with the power
        of constitutional amendments handed over to the Legislative Yuan and all eligible
        voters of the Republic via referendums.</p>\n<p>The premier is selected by
        the president without the need for approval from the legislature, but the
        legislature can pass laws without regard for the president, as neither he
        nor the Premier wields veto power. Thus, there is little incentive for the
        president and the legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing
        parties. After the election of the pan-Green''s Chen Shui-bian as President
        in 2000, legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the Legislative
        Yuan, which was controlled by a pan-Blue majority. Historically, the ROC has
        been dominated by strongman single party politics. This legacy has resulted
        in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the president
        rather than the premier, even though the constitution does not explicitly
        state the extent of the president''s executive power.</p>\n<p>The Judicial
        Yuan is the highest judicial organ. It interprets the constitution and other
        laws and decrees, judges administrative suits, and disciplines public functionaries.
        The president and vice-president of the Judicial Yuan and additional thirteen
        justices form the Council of Grand Justices. They are nominated and appointed
        by the president, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The highest court,
        the Supreme Court, consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each
        of which is formed by a presiding judge and four associate judges, all appointed
        for life. In 1993, a separate constitutional court was established to resolve
        constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and
        accelerate the democratization process. There is no trial by jury but the
        right to a fair public trial is protected by law and respected in practice;
        many cases are presided over by multiple judges.</p>\n\n<p>Capital punishment
        is still used in Taiwan, although efforts have been made by the government
        to reduce the number of executions. Nevertheless, according to a survey in
        2006, about 80% of Taiwanese still wanted to keep the death penalty.</p>\n<p>The
        Control Yuan is a watchdog agency that monitors (controls) the actions of
        the executive. It can be considered a standing commission for administrative
        inquiry and can be compared to the Court of Auditors of the European Union
        or the Government Accountability Office of the United States.</p>\n<p>The
        Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants.
        It is based on the old imperial examination system used in dynastic China.
        It can be compared to the European Personnel Selection Office of the European
        Union or the Office of Personnel Management of the United States.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Major_camps\">Major camps</span></h3>\n\n<p>The tension between China
        and Taiwan colours most of the political life, and any government move towards
        \"Taiwan independence\" is met by threat of military attack from the PRC.
        The PRC''s official policy is to reunify Taiwan and mainland China under the
        formula of \"one country, two systems\" and refuses to renounce the use of
        military force, especially should Taiwan seek a declaration of independence.</p>\n<p>The
        political scene is generally divided into two major camps in terms of views
        on how Taiwan should relate to China or the PRC, referred to as cross-Strait
        relations. It is the main political difference between two camps: the Pan-Blue
        Coalition, composed of the pro-unification Kuomintang, People First Party
        (PFP), and New Party, who believe that the ROC is the sole legitimate government
        of \"China\" (including Taiwan) and supports eventual Chinese reunification.
        The opposition Pan-Green Coalition is composed of the pro-independence DPP
        and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU). It regards Taiwan as an independent, sovereign
        state synonymous with the ROC, opposes the definition that Taiwan is part
        of \"China\", and seeks wide diplomatic recognition and an eventual declaration
        of formal Taiwan independence. The Pan-Green camp tends to favour emphasizing
        the Republic of China as being a distinct country from the People''s Republic
        of China. Thus, in September 2007, the then ruling Democratic Progressive
        Party approved a resolution asserting separate identity from China and called
        for the enactment of a new constitution for a \"<i>normal country</i>\". It
        called also for general use of \"<i>Taiwan</i>\" as the country''s name, without
        abolishing its formal name, the \"Republic of China\". Some members of the
        coalition, such as former President Chen Shui-bian, argue that it is unnecessary
        to proclaim independence because \"Taiwan is already an independent, sovereign
        country\" and the Republic of China is the same as Taiwan. Despite being a
        member of KMT prior to and during his presidency, Lee Teng-hui also held a
        similar view and was a supporter of the Taiwanization movement.</p>\n<p>Pan-Blue
        members generally support the concept of the One-China policy, which states
        that there is only one China and that its only government is the ROC. They
        favour eventual re-unification of China. The more mainstream Pan-Blue position
        is to lift investment restrictions and pursue negotiations with the PRC to
        immediately open direct transportation links. Regarding independence, the
        mainstream Pan-Blue position is to maintain the status quo, while refusing
        immediate reunification. President Ma Ying-jeou stated that there will be
        no unification nor declaration of independence during his presidency. As of
        2009, Pan-Blue members usually seek to improve relationships with mainland
        China, with a current focus on improving economic ties.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Current_political_issues\">Current
        political issues</span></h3>\n<p>The dominant political issue in Taiwan is
        its relationship with the PRC. For almost 60\u00a0years, there were no direct
        transportation links, including direct flights, between Taiwan and mainland
        China. This was a problem for many Taiwanese businesses that had opened factories
        or branches in mainland China. The former DPP administration feared that such
        links would lead to tighter economic and political integration with mainland
        China, and in the 2006 Lunar New Year Speech, President Chen Shui-bian called
        for managed opening of links. Direct weekend charter flights between Taiwan
        and mainland China began in July 2008 under the current KMT government, and
        the first direct daily charter flights took off in December 2008.</p>\n<p>Other
        major political issues include the passage of an arms procurement bill that
        the United States authorized in 2001. In 2008, however, the United States
        was reluctant to send over more arms to Taiwan out of fear that it would hinder
        the recent improvement of ties between the PRC and the ROC. Another major
        political issue is the establishment of a National Communications Commission
        to take over from the Government Information Office, whose advertising budget
        exercised great control over the media.</p>\n<p>The politicians and their
        parties have themselves become major political issues. Corruption among some
        DPP administration officials has been exposed. In early 2006, President Chen
        Shui-bian was linked to possible corruption. The political effect on President
        Chen Shui-bian was great, causing a divide in the DPP leadership and supporters
        alike. It eventually led to the creation of a political camp led by ex-DPP
        leader Shih Ming-teh which believes the president should resign. The KMT assets
        continue to be another major issue, as it was once the richest political party
        in the world. Nearing the end of 2006, KMT''s chairman Ma Ying-jeou was also
        hit by corruption controversies, although he has since then been cleared of
        any wrongdoings by the courts. After completing his second term as President,
        Chen Shui-bian was charged with corruption and money laundering. Following
        his conviction, he is serving a 17-year sentence in Taipei Prison.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"National_identity\">National identity</span></h3>\n\n<p>Roughly 84% of
        Taiwan''s population descends from Han Chinese who migrated from Qing China
        between 1661 and 1895. Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese
        who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The
        shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical
        separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences,
        as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national
        identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratization
        and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed
        to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart
        of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland
        China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for
        <i>de jure</i> Taiwan independence. The pan-green camp supports a distinct
        Taiwanese identity, while the pan-blue camp supports a Chinese identity only.
        The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a
        Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.</p>\n<p>According to a survey
        conducted in March 2009, 49% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese
        only, and 44% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese and Chinese.
        3% consider themselves as only Chinese. Another survey, conducted in Taiwan
        in July 2009, showed that 82.8% of respondents consider the ROC and the PRC
        as two separate countries with each developing on its own. A survey conducted
        in December 2009 showed that 62% of the respondents consider themselves as
        Taiwanese only, and 22% of the respondents consider themselves as both Taiwanese
        and Chinese. 8% consider themselves as only Chinese. The survey also shows
        that among 18- to 29-year-old respondents, 75% consider themselves as Taiwanese
        only.</p>\n<p>In the latest survey conducted by National Chengchi University
        in 2014 and published in early 2015, 60.6% of respondents identified themselves
        exclusively as Taiwanese, 32.5% identified themselves as both Taiwanese and
        Chinese and 3.5% identified themselves as Chinese.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Military\">Military</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The
        Republic of China Army takes its roots in the National Revolutionary Army,
        which was established by Sun Yat-sen in 1925 in Guangdong with a goal of reunifying
        China under the Kuomintang. When the People''s Liberation Army won the Chinese
        Civil War, much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along
        with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army.
        Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded
        or incorporated into the People''s Liberation Army.</p>\n<p>Today, the Republic
        of China maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as
        defence against the constant threat of invasion by the PRC under the Anti-Secession
        Law of the People''s Republic of China. From 1949 to the 1970s, the primary
        mission of the military was to \"retake the mainland\" through Project National
        Glory. As this mission has shifted to defence, the ROC military has begun
        to shift emphasis from the traditionally dominant Army to the air force and
        navy.</p>\n<p>Control of the armed forces has also passed into the hands of
        the civilian government. As the ROC military shares historical roots with
        the KMT, the older generation of high-ranking officers tends to have Pan-Blue
        sympathies. However, many have retired and there are many more non-mainlanders
        enlisting in the armed forces in the younger generations, so the political
        leanings of the military have moved closer to the public norm in Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The
        ROC began a force reduction program, Jingshi An (translated to streamlining
        program), to scale down its military from a level of 450,000 in 1997 to 380,000
        in 2001. As of 2009, the armed forces of the ROC number approximately 300,000,
        with nominal reserves totalling 3.6\u00a0million as of 2005. Conscription
        remains universal for qualified males reaching age eighteen, but as a part
        of the reduction effort many are given the opportunity to fulfill their draft
        requirement through alternative service and are redirected to government agencies
        or defence related industries. Current plans call for a transition to a predominantly
        professional army over the next decade. Conscription periods are planned to
        decrease from 14\u00a0months to 12. In the last months of the Bush administration,
        Taipei took the decision to reverse the trend of declining defence spending,
        at a time when most Asian countries kept on reducing their military expenditures.
        It also decided to modernize both defensive and offensive capabilities. Taipei
        still keeps a large military apparatus relative to the island''s population:
        defence expenditures for 2008 were NTD 334 billion (approximately US $10.5
        billion), which accounted for 2.94% of GDP.</p>\n\n\n<p>The armed forces''
        primary concern at this time, according to the <i>National Defense Report</i>,
        is the possibility of an invasion by the PRC, consisting of a naval blockade,
        airborne assault, and/or missile bombardment. Four upgraded <i>Kidd</i>-class
        destroyers were purchased from the United States, and commissioned into the
        Republic of China Navy in 2005\u20132006, significantly upgrading Taiwan''s
        air defence and submarine hunting abilities. The Ministry of National Defense
        planned to purchase diesel-powered submarines and Patriot anti-missile batteries
        from the United States, but its budget has been stalled repeatedly by the
        opposition-Pan-Blue Coalition controlled legislature. The defence package
        was stalled from 2001 to 2007 where it was finally passed through the legislature
        and the US responded on 3 October 2008, with a $6.5\u00a0billion arms package
        including PAC III Anti-Air defence systems, AH-64D Apache Attack helicopters
        and other arms and parts. A significant amount of military hardware has been
        bought from the United States, and, as of 2009, continues to be legally guaranteed
        by the Taiwan Relations Act. In the past, France and the Netherlands have
        also sold military weapons and hardware to the ROC, but they almost entirely
        stopped in the 1990s under pressure of the PRC.</p>\n<p>The first line of
        defence against invasion by the PRC is the ROC''s own armed forces. Current
        ROC military doctrine is to hold out against an invasion or blockade until
        the US military responds. There is, however, no guarantee in the Taiwan Relations
        Act or any other treaty that the United States will defend Taiwan, even in
        the event of invasion. The joint declaration on security between the US and
        Japan signed in 1996 may imply that Japan would be involved in any response.
        However, Japan has refused to stipulate whether the \"area surrounding Japan\"
        mentioned in the pact includes Taiwan, and the precise purpose of the pact
        is unclear. The Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS
        Treaty) may mean that other US allies, such as Australia, could theoretically
        be involved. In practice, the risk of losing economic ties with China may
        prevent Australia from taking action. The United States, United Kingdom, Japan,
        South Korea, Australia, Canada, Chile, and Peru conduct maritime exercises
        in the Pacific Ocean every two years called RIMPAC. They are conducted to
        promote stability and to be able to respond in case of an armed conflict in
        the region \u2013 that includes an invasion of Taiwan by China.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Administrative_divisions\">Administrative divisions</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According
        to the 1947 constitution, the territory of the ROC is according to its \"existing
        national boundaries\". According to the Executive Yuan in 2012, Mongolia was
        re-recognized by Republic of China as an independent country when the constitution
        was announced in 1946.</p>\n<p>When the ROC retreated to Taiwan in 1949, its
        claimed territory consisted of 35 provinces, 12 special municipalities, 1
        special administrative region and 2 autonomous regions. However, since its
        retreat, the ROC has controlled only Taiwan Province and some islands of Fujian
        Province. The ROC also controls the Pratas Islands and Taiping Island in the
        Spratly Islands, which are part of the disputed South China Sea Islands. They
        were placed under Kaohsiung administration after the retreat to Taiwan.</p>\n<p>Since
        1949, the government has made some changes in the area under its control.
        Taipei became a special municipality in 1967 and Kaohsiung in 1979. The two
        provincial governments were \"streamlined\", with their functions transferred
        to the central government (Fujian in 1956 and Taiwan in 1998). In 2010, New
        Taipei, Taichung and Tainan were upgraded to special municipalities. And in
        2014, Taoyuan County was also upgraded to Taoyuan special municipality. This
        brought the top-level divisions to their current state:</p>\n<p>According
        to Article 4 of the Local Government Act, laws pertaining to special municipalities
        also apply to counties with a population exceeding 2 million. This provision
        does not currently apply to any county, although it previously applied to
        Taipei County (now New Taipei City) and Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City).</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Economy_and_industry\">Economy and industry</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The quick
        industrialization and rapid growth of Taiwan during the latter half of the
        20th century has been called the \"Taiwan Miracle\". Taiwan is one of the
        \"Four Asian Tigers\" alongside Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.</p>\n<p>Japanese
        rule prior to and during World War II brought changes in the public and private
        sectors, most notably in the area of public works, which enabled rapid communications
        and facilitated transport throughout much of the island. The Japanese also
        improved public education and made it compulsory for all residents of Taiwan.</p>\n<p>By
        1945, hyperinflation was in progress in mainland China and Taiwan as a result
        of the war with Japan. To isolate Taiwan from it, the Nationalist government
        created a new currency area for the island, and began a price stabilization
        program. These efforts significantly slowed inflation.</p>\n<p>When the KMT
        government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of taels (where 1\u00a0tael
        ~1.2\u00a0ozt) of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China,
        which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.
        Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought
        the intellectual and business elites from Mainland China. The KMT government
        instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted
        on mainland China. The government also implemented a policy of import-substitution,
        attempting to produce imported goods domestically.</p>\n<p>In 1950, with the
        outbreak of the Korean War, the United States began an aid program which resulted
        in fully stabilized prices by 1952. Economic development was encouraged by
        American economic aid and programs such as the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction,
        which turned the agricultural sector into the basis for later growth. Under
        the combined stimulus of the land reform and the agricultural development
        programs, agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 4
        per cent from 1952 to 1959, which was greater than the population growth,
        3.6%.</p>\n<p>In 1962, Taiwan had a (nominal) per-capita gross national product
        (GNP) of $170, placing its economy on a par with those of the Democratic Republic
        of the Congo. On a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, its GDP per capita
        in the early 1960s was $1,353 (in 1990 prices). By 2011 per-capita GNP, adjusted
        for purchasing power parity (PPP), had risen to $37,000, contributing to a
        Human Development Index (HDI) equivalent to that of other developed countries.
        Taiwan''s HDI in 2012 is 0.890, (23rd, very high), according to the UN''s
        new \"Inequality-adjusted HDI\" calculation method.</p>\n<p>In 1974, Chiang
        Ching-kuo implemented the Ten Major Construction Projects, the beginning foundations
        that helped Taiwan transform into its current export driven economy. Since
        the 1990s, a number of Taiwan-based technology firms have expanded their reach
        around the world. Well-known international technology companies headquartered
        in Taiwan include personal computer manufacturers Acer Inc. and Asus, mobile
        phone maker HTC, as well as electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn, which
        makes products for Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Computex Taipei is a major
        computer expo, held since 1981.</p>\n\n<p>Today Taiwan has a dynamic, capitalist,
        export-driven economy with gradually decreasing state involvement in investment
        and foreign trade. In keeping with this trend, some large government-owned
        banks and industrial firms are being privatized. Real growth in GDP has averaged
        about 8% during the past three decades. Exports have provided the primary
        impetus for industrialization. The trade surplus is substantial, and foreign
        reserves are the world''s fifth largest. The Republic of China has its own
        currency, the New Taiwan dollar.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the 1990s,
        the economic ties between Taiwan and the People''s Republic of China have
        been very prolific. As of 2008, more than US$150 billion have been invested
        in the PRC by Taiwanese companies, and about 10% of the Taiwanese labour force
        works in the PRC, often to run their own businesses. Although the economy
        of Taiwan benefits from this situation, some have expressed the view that
        the island has become increasingly dependent on the Mainland Chinese economy.
        A 2008 white paper by the Department of Industrial Technology states that
        \"Taiwan should seek to maintain stable relation with China while continuing
        to protect national security, and avoiding excessive ''Sinicization'' of Taiwanese
        economy.\" Others argue that close economic ties between Taiwan and Mainland
        China would make any military intervention by the PLA against Taiwan very
        costly, and therefore less probable.</p>\n<p>Taiwan''s total trade in 2010
        reached an all-time high of US$526.04 billion, according to Taiwan''s Ministry
        of Finance. Both exports and imports for the year reached record levels, totalling
        US$274.64 billion and US$251.4 billion, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, agriculture
        constituted only 2% of GDP, down from 35% in 1952. Traditional labour-intensive
        industries are steadily being moved offshore and with more capital and technology-intensive
        industries replacing them. High-technology industrial parks have sprung up
        in every region in Taiwan. The ROC has become a major foreign investor in
        the PRC, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. It is
        estimated that some 50,000\u00a0Taiwanese businesses and 1,000,000\u00a0businesspeople
        and their dependents are established in the PRC.</p>\n<p>Because of its conservative
        financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little
        compared with many of its neighbours from the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
        Unlike its neighbours, South Korea and Japan, the Taiwanese economy is dominated
        by small and medium-sized businesses, rather than the large business groups.
        The global economic downturn, however, combined with poor policy co-ordination
        by the new administration and increasing bad debts in the banking system,
        pushed Taiwan into recession in 2001, the first whole year of negative growth
        since 1947. Due to the relocation of many manufacturing and labour-intensive
        industries to the PRC, unemployment also reached a level not seen since the
        1970s oil crisis. This became a major issue in the 2004 presidential election.
        Growth averaged more than 4% in the 2002\u20132006 period and the unemployment
        rate fell below 4%.</p>\n<p>The ROC often joins international organizations
        (especially ones that also include the People''s Republic of China) under
        a politically neutral name. The ROC has been a member of governmental trade
        organizations such as the World Trade Organization under the name Separate
        Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei) since
        2002.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Transportation\">Transportation</span></h2>\n\n<p>The
        Ministry of Transportation and Communications of the Republic of China is
        the cabinet-level governing body of the transportation network in Taiwan.
        Taiwan has an extensive highway network, classified into five levels: national
        highways, provincial highways, county routes, township routes, and special
        routes, with the first four being common. Taiwan also has an extensive bus
        network, most of which are run by private bus companies. Inter-city rail services
        are provided by Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) and Taiwan High Speed
        Rail (THSR). Rapid transit systems include the Taipei Metro, Taoyuan Metro
        (incl. the Airport MRT) and Kaohsiung MRT, while Taichung Metro is under construction.
        Major airports include Taiwan Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, Taipei Songshan and Taichung.
        There are currently seven airlines in Taiwan, the largest ones being China
        Airlines and EVA Air. There are four international seaports: Keelung, Kaohsiung,
        Taichung, and Hualien.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Education,_research,_and_academia\"></span><span
        id=\"Education.2C_research.2C_and_academia\">Education, research, and academia</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The
        higher education system was established in Taiwan by Japan during the colonial
        period. However, after the Republic of China took over Taiwan from Japan in
        1945, the system was promptly replaced by the same system as in mainland China
        which mixed with features of the Chinese and American educational systems.</p>\n<p>Taiwan
        is well known for adhering to the Confucian paradigm of valuing education
        as a means to improve one''s socioeconomic position in Taiwanese society.
        Heavy investment and a cultural value for education has catapulted the resource
        poor nation consistently atop the global education rankings. Taiwan is one
        of the top-performing countries in reading literacy, maths and sciences. In
        2015, Taiwanese students achieved one of the world''s best results in mathematics,
        science and literacy, as tested by the Programme for International Student
        Assessment (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils'' scholastic
        performance. The strong scholastic and educational performance of Taiwanese
        students has prompted the nation to build a highly educated labour force that
        possesses a strong background in mathematics and science to cope with the
        current labor market demands of the 21st century.</p>\n<p>The Taiwanese education
        system has been praised for various reasons including its comparatively high
        test results and its major role in ushering Taiwan''s economic development
        while creating one of the world\u2019s most highly educated workforces. The
        country has also been praised for its high university entrance rate where
        the university acceptance rate has increased from around 20 percent before
        the 1970s to 49 percent in 1996 and over 90 percent since 2006, among the
        highest in Asia. The nation''s high university entrance rate has created a
        highly skilled workforce making Taiwan one of the most highly educated countries
        in the world with 68.5% of Taiwanese high school students going on to attend
        university. Taiwan has a high percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary
        education degree where 45 percent of Taiwanese aged 25\u201364 hold a bachelors
        degree or higher compared with the average of 33 percent among member countries
        of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). On the
        other hand, the system has been criticized for placing excessive pressure
        on students and eschewing creativity in favor of rote memorization. In addition,
        the system has been criticized for producing an excess supply of over-educated
        university graduates and a higher unemployment rate. With a large supply of
        university graduates seeking a limited demand of prestigious white collar
        jobs in an environment that is increasingly losing its competitive edge has
        led many degree holders ending up with lower end jobs with salaries far beneath
        than their expectations. Taiwan\u2019s universities have also been under criticism
        for not being able to fully meet the requirements and demands of Taiwan\u2019s
        21st century fast-moving job market citing a skills mismatch among a large
        number of self-assessed overeducated university graduates that don''t fit
        the demands of the modern Taiwanese labor market. The Taiwanese government
        has also been criticized for undermining the economy as it has been unable
        to produce enough jobs to meet the demands of numerous underemployed university
        graduates.</p>\n<p>As the Taiwanese economy is largely science and technology
        based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher
        education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain
        a competitive edge when searching for employment. Although current Taiwanese
        law mandates only nine years of schooling, 95% of junior high graduates go
        on to attend a senior vocational high school, university, junior college,
        trade school, or other higher education institution.</p>\n<p>Many Taiwanese
        students attend cram schools, or bushiban, to improve skills and knowledge
        on problem solving against exams of subjects like mathematics, nature science,
        history and many others. Courses are available for most popular subjects.
        Lessons are organized in lectures, reviews, private tutorial sessions, and
        recitations.</p>\n<p>As of 2013, the literacy rate in Taiwan is 97.15%.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Demographics\">Demographics</span></h2>\n\n<p>Taiwan''s population is
        about 23.4 million, most of whom are on the island proper. The remainder live
        on Penghu (101,758), Kinmen (127,723), and Matsu (12,506).</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Ethnic_groups\">Ethnic groups</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The ROC government
        reports that over 95% of the population is Han, of which the majority includes
        descendants of early Han Chinese immigrants who arrived in Taiwan in large
        numbers starting in the 18th century. Alternatively, the ethnic groups of
        Taiwan may be roughly divided among the Hoklo (70%), the Hakka (14%), the
        Waishengren (14%), and indigenous peoples (2%).</p>\n<p>The Hoklo people are
        the largest Han subgroup (70% of the total population), whose ancestors migrated
        from the coastal southern Fujian region across the Taiwan Strait starting
        in the 17th century. The Hakka comprise about 15% of the total population,
        and descend from Han migrants to Guangdong, its surrounding areas and Taiwan.
        Additional people of Han origin include and descend from the 2 million Nationalists
        who fled to Taiwan following the communist victory on the mainland in 1949.</p>\n<p>The
        indigenous Taiwanese aborigines number about 533,600 and are divided into
        16 recognized groups. The Ami, Atayal, Bunun, Kanakanavu, Kavalan, Paiwan,
        Puyuma, Rukai, Saisiyat, Saaroa, Sakizaya, Sediq, Thao, Truku and Tsou live
        mostly in the eastern half of the island, while the Yami inhabit Orchid Island.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Languages\">Languages</span></h3>\n\n<p>Mandarin is the official national
        language and is spoken by the vast majority of the population of Taiwan. It
        has been the primary language of instruction in schools since the end of Japanese
        rule. As in Hong Kong and Macau, Traditional Chinese is used as the writing
        system in Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The 70% of the population belonging to the Hoklo
        ethnic group speak Taiwanese Hokkien (a variant of the Min Nan speech of Fujian
        province) as their mother tongue, in addition to Mandarin, and many others
        have some degree of understanding. The Hakka ethnic group (15% of the population)
        use Hakka Chinese. Most <i>waishengren</i> speak primarily Mandarin. Although
        Mandarin is the language of instruction in schools and dominates television
        and radio, non-Mandarin Chinese varieties have undergone a revival in public
        life in Taiwan, particularly since restrictions on their use were lifted in
        the 1990s.</p>\n<p>Taiwan''s indigenous languages, the Formosan languages,
        do not belong to the Chinese or Sino-Tibetan language family, but rather to
        the Austronesian language family. Their use among Taiwan''s aboriginal minority
        groups has been in decline as usage of Mandarin has risen. Of the 14 extant
        languages, five are considered moribund.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Religion\">Religion</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        Constitution of the Republic of China protects people''s freedom of religion
        and the practices of belief. There are approximately 18,718,600 religious
        followers in Taiwan as of 2005 (81.3% of total population) and 14\u201318%
        are non-religious. According to the 2005 census, of the 26 religions recognized
        by the ROC government, the five largest are: Buddhism (8,086,000 or 35.1%),
        Taoism (7,600,000 or 33%), Yiguandao (810,000 or 3.5%), Protestantism (605,000
        or 2.6%), and Roman Catholicism (298,000 or 1.3%).</p>\n<p>The CIA World Factbook
        reports that over 93% of Taiwanese are adherents of a combination of the polytheistic
        Chinese popular religion, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism; 4.5% are adherents
        of Christianity, which includes Protestants, Catholics, and other, non-denominational,
        Christian groups; and less than 2.5% are adherents of other religions. Taiwanese
        aborigines comprise a notable subgroup among professing Christians: \"...over
        64% identify as Christian... Church buildings are the most obvious markers
        of Aboriginal villages, distinguishing them from Taiwanese or Hakka villages.\"</p>\n<p>Confucianism
        is a philosophy that deals with secular moral ethics, and serves as the foundation
        of both Chinese and Taiwanese culture. The majority of Taiwanese people usually
        combine the secular moral teachings of Confucianism with whatever religions
        they are affiliated with.</p>\n<p>As of 2009, there were 14,993 temples in
        Taiwan, approximately one place of worship per 1,500 residents. 9,202 of those
        temples were dedicated to Taoism. In 2008, Taiwan had 3,262 Churches, an increase
        of 145.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Largest_cities\">Largest cities</span></h3>\n\n<p>The

        is managed by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI).</p>\n<p>The
        current program was implemented in 1995, and is considered to be a form of
        social insurance. The government health insurance program maintains compulsory
        insurance for citizens who are employed, impoverished, unemployed, or victims
        of natural disasters with fees that correlate to the individual and/or family
        income; it also maintains protection for non-citizens working in Taiwan. A
        standardized method of calculation applies to all persons and can optionally
        be paid by an employer or by individual contributions.</p>\n<p>BNHI insurance
        coverage requires co-payment at the time of service for most services unless
        it is a preventative health service, for low-income families, veterans, children
        under three years old, or in the case of catastrophic diseases. Low income
        households maintain 100% premium coverage by the BNHI and co-pays are reduced
        for disabled or certain elderly people.</p>\n<p>According to a recently published
        survey, out of 3,360\u00a0patients surveyed at a randomly chosen hospital,
        75.1% of the patients said they are \"very satisfied\" with the hospital service;
        20.5% said they are \"okay\" with the service. Only 4.4% of the patients said
        they are either \"not satisfied\" or \"very not satisfied\" with the service
        or care provided.</p>\n<p>Taiwan has its own Center for Disease Control, and
        during the SARS outbreak in March 2003 there were 347\u00a0confirmed cases.
        During the outbreak the Centers for Disease Control and local governments
        set up monitored stations throughout public transportation, recreational sites
        and other public areas. With full containment in July 2003, there has not
        been a case of SARS since.</p>\n<p>As of 2006, the BNHI Facility Contract

        id=\"Culture\">Culture</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The cultures of Taiwan are a hybrid
        blend of various sources, incorporating elements of traditional Chinese culture,
        attributable to the historical and ancestry origin of the majority of its
        current residents, Japanese culture, traditional Confucianist beliefs, and
        increasingly Western values.</p>\n<p>After their move to Taiwan, the Kuomintang
        imposed an official interpretation of traditional Chinese culture over Taiwan.
        The government launched a program promoting Chinese calligraphy, traditional
        Chinese painting, folk art, and Chinese opera.</p>\n<p>The status of Taiwanese
        culture is debated. It is disputed whether Taiwanese culture is a regional
        form of Chinese culture or a distinct culture. Reflecting the continuing controversy
        surrounding the political status of Taiwan, politics continues to play a role
        in the conception and development of a Taiwanese cultural identity, especially
        in the prior dominant frame of a Taiwanese and Chinese dualism. In recent
        years, the concept of Taiwanese multiculturalism has been proposed as a relatively
        apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders
        and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture
        as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought
        and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan. Identity politics, along with
        the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has
        led to distinct traditions in many areas, including cuisine and music.</p>\n\n<p>One
        of Taiwan''s greatest attractions is the National Palace Museum, which houses
        more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting, and
        porcelain and is considered one of the greatest collections of Chinese art
        and objects in the world. The KMT moved this collection from the Forbidden
        City in Beijing in 1933 and part of the collection was eventually transported
        to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. The collection, estimated to be one-tenth
        of China''s cultural treasures, is so extensive that only 1% is on display
        at any time. The PRC had said that the collection was stolen and has called
        for its return, but the ROC has long defended its control of the collection
        as a necessary act to protect the pieces from destruction, especially during
        the Cultural Revolution. Relations regarding this treasure have warmed recently;
        Beijing Palace Museum Curator Zheng Xinmiao said that artefacts in both Chinese
        and Taiwanese museums are \"China''s cultural heritage jointly owned by people
        across the Taiwan Strait.\"</p>\n<p>The classical music culture in Taiwan
        is highly developed and features artists such as violinist Cho-Liang Lin,
        pianist Ching-Yun Hu, and the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society Artist
        Director Wu Han. Karaoke, drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely
        popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like
        style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms varying on the number of guests
        in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to
        form all-encompassing elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or
        businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV''s, equipped
        not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment
        counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the
        city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theatre
        room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a
        place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.</p>\n<p>Taiwan
        has a high density of 24-hour convenience stores, which, in addition to the
        usual services, provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government
        agencies such as collection of parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation
        fines, and credit card payments. They also provide a service for mailing packages.</p>\n<p>Taiwanese
        culture has also influenced other cultures. Bubble tea and milk tea are available
        in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Taiwan television
        shows are popular in Singapore, Malaysia, and other Asian countries. Taiwanese
        films have won various international awards at film festivals around the world.
        Ang Lee, a Taiwanese director, has directed critically acclaimed films such
        as: <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>; <i>Eat Drink Man Woman</i>; <i>Sense
        and Sensibility</i>; <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>; <i>Life of Pi</i>; and <i>Lust,
        Caution</i>. Other famous Taiwanese directors include Tsai Ming-Liang, Edward
        Yang, and Hou Hsiao-hsien.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sports\">Sports</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Baseball
        is Taiwan''s national sport and it is a popular spectator sport. Two of the
        most famous Taiwanese baseball pitchers are Chien-Ming Wang and Wei-Yin Chen;
        both are pitchers in Major League Baseball. Other notable players playing
        in the United States include Chin-hui Tsao who played for the Colorado Rockies
        (2003\u20132005) and the Los Angeles Dodgers (2007, 2015\u20132016), Hong-Chih
        Kuo, Fu-Te Ni, and Chin-lung Hu. The Chinese Professional Baseball League
        in Taiwan was established in 1989, and eventually absorbed the competing Taiwan
        Major League in 2003. As of 2015, the CPBL has four teams with average attendance
        over 5,000 per game.</p>\n<p>Besides baseball, basketball is Taiwan''s major
        sport. Taekwondo has also become a mature and successful sport in recent years.
        In the 2004 Olympics, Chen Shih-hsin and Chu Mu-yen won the first two gold
        medals in women''s flyweight event and men''s flyweight event, respectively.
        Subsequent taekwondo competitors such as Yang Shu-chun have strengthened Taiwan''s
        taekwondo culture.</p>\n<p>Taiwan participates in international sporting organizations
        and events under the name of \"Chinese Taipei\" due to its political status.
        In 2009, Taiwan hosted two international sporting events on the island. The
        World Games 2009 were held in Kaohsiung between 16 and 26 July 2009. Taipei
        hosted the 21st Summer Deaflympics in September of the same year. Furthermore,
        Taipei will host the Summer Universiade in 2017.</p>\n<p>Taiwan is also a
        major Asian country for Korfball. In 2008, Taiwan hosted the World Youth Korfball
        Championship and took the silver medal. In 2009, Taiwan''s korfball team won
        a bronze medal at the World Game.</p>\n<p>Yani Tseng is the most famous Taiwanese
        professional golfer currently playing on the US-based LPGA Tour. She is the
        youngest player ever, male or female, to win five major championships and
        had been ranked number 1 in the Women''s World Golf Rankings for 109 consecutive
        weeks from 2011 to 2013.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Calendar\">Calendar</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taiwan
        uses two official calendars: the Gregorian calendar and the Minguo calendar.
        The latter numbers years starting from 1911, the year of the founding of the
        Republic of China. For example, 2007 was the \"96th year of the Republic\"
        (\u6c11\u570b96\u5e74), while its months and days were numbered according
        to the Gregorian calendar.</p>\n<p>Usually, year numbering may use the Gregorian
        system as well as the ROC era system. For example, 3 May 2004, may be written
        2004-05-03 or 93-05-03. The use of two different calendar systems in Taiwan
        may be confusing, in particular for foreigners. For instance, products for
        export marked using the Minguo calendar can be misunderstood as having an
        expiration date 11\u00a0years earlier than intended.</p>\n<p>Taiwan also uses
        the lunar calendar for traditional festivals such as the Chinese New Year,
        the Lantern Festival, and the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See

        officially the <b>Republic of China</b> (<b>ROC</b>), is a state in East Asia.
        Its neighbors include the People''s Republic of China to the west, Japan to
        the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous
        state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations.</p>\n<p>The
        island of Taiwan, formerly known as Formosa, was inhabited by Taiwanese aborigines
        before the 17th century, when Dutch and Spanish colonies opened the island
        to mass Han immigration. After a brief rule by the Kingdom of Tungning, the
        island was annexed by the Qing dynasty, the last dynasty of China. The Qing
        ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895 after the Sino-Japanese War. While Taiwan was
        under Japanese rule, the Republic of China (ROC) was established on the mainland
        in 1912 after the fall of the Qing dynasty. Following the Japanese surrender
        to the Allies in 1945, the ROC took control of Taiwan. However, the resumption
        of the Chinese Civil War led to the ROC''s loss of the mainland to the Communists,
        and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949. Although the ROC continued
        to claim to be the legitimate government of China, its effective jurisdiction
        has, since the loss of Hainan in 1950, been limited to Taiwan and its surrounding
        islands, with the main island making up 99% of its <i>de facto</i> territory.
        As a founding member of the United Nations, the ROC continued to represent
        China at the United Nations until 1971, when the PRC assumed China''s seat,
        causing the ROC to lose its UN membership.</p>\n<p>In the early 1960s, Taiwan
        entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialization, creating
        a stable industrial economy. In the 1980s and early 1990s, it changed from
        a one-party military dictatorship dominated by the Kuomintang to a multi-party
        democracy with a semi-presidential system. Taiwan is the 22nd-largest economy
        in the world, and its high-tech industry plays a key role in the global economy.
        It is ranked highly in terms of freedom of the press, healthcare, public education,
        economic freedom, and human development. The country benefits from a highly
        skilled workforce and is among the most highly educated countries in the world
        with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education
        degree.</p>\n<p>The PRC has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and
        asserted the ROC is no longer in legitimate existence. Under its One-China
        Policy the PRC refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes
        the ROC. Today 20 countries maintain official ties with the ROC but many other
        states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices and institutions
        that function as <i>de facto</i> embassies and consulates. Although Taiwan
        is fully self-governing, most international organizations in which the PRC
        participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate
        only as a non-state actor. Internally, the major division in politics is between
        the aspirations of eventual Chinese unification or Taiwanese independence,
        though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal.
        The PRC has threatened the use of military force in response to any formal
        declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful
        unification is no longer possible.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n\n<p>There
        are various names for the island of Taiwan in use today, derived from explorers
        or rulers by each particular period. The former name Formosa (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u798f\u723e\u6469\u6c99</span>)
        dates from 1542, when Portuguese sailors sighted the main island of Taiwan
        and named it <i>Ilha Formosa</i>, which means \"beautiful island\". The name
        \"Formosa\" eventually \"replaced all others in European literature\" and
        was in common use in English in the early 20th century.</p>\n<p>In the early
        17th century, the Dutch East India Company established a commercial post at
        Fort Zeelandia (modern-day Anping, Tainan) on a coastal sandbar called \"Tayouan\",
        after their ethnonym for a nearby Taiwanese aboriginal tribe, written by the
        Dutch and Portuguese variously as <i>Taiouwang</i>, <i>Tayowan</i>, <i>Teijoan</i>,
        etc. This name was also adopted into the Chinese vernacular (in particular,
        Hokkien, as Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: <i><span lang=\"nan\">T\u0101i-o\u00e2n/T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n</span></i>)
        as the name of the sandbar and nearby area (Tainan). The modern word \"Taiwan\"
        is derived from this usage, which is seen in various forms (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u5927\u54e1,
        \u5927\u5713, \u5927\u7063, \u81fa\u54e1, \u81fa\u5713</span> and <span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u81fa\u7aa9\u7063</span>)
        in Chinese historical records. The area of modern-day Tainan was the first
        permanent settlement by Western colonists and Chinese immigrants, grew to
        be the most important trading centre, and served as the capital of the island
        until 1887. Use of the current Chinese name (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u81fa\u7063</span>)
        was formalized as early as 1684 with the establishment of Taiwan Prefecture.
        Through its rapid development, the entire Formosan mainland eventually became
        known as \"Taiwan\".</p>\n<p>In his <i>Daoyi Zhil\u00fce</i> (1349), Wang
        Dayuan used \"Liuqiu\" as a name for the island of Taiwan, or the part of
        it near to Penghu. Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in
        general or Okinawa, the largest of them; indeed the name <i>Ry\u016bky\u016b</i>
        is the Japanese form of <i>Li\u00faqi\u00fa</i>. The name also appears in
        the <i>Book of Sui</i> (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree
        on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even Luzon.</p>\n<p>The
        official name of the state is the \"Republic of China\"; it has also been
        known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC''s
        establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland,
        the government used the short form \"China\" <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3</span></i>
        <span>(<span lang=\"zh\">\u4e2d\u570b</span>),</span> to refer to itself,
        which derives from <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">zh\u014dng</span></i>
        (\"central\" or \"middle\") and <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">gu\u00f3</span></i>
        (\"state, nation-state\"),  A term which also developed under the Zhou Dynasty
        in reference to its royal demesne and the name was then applied to the area
        around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China''s
        Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under
        the Qingera . During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had fled to
        Taiwan due to losing the Chinese Civil War, it was commonly referred to as
        \"<b>Nationalist China</b>\" (or \"Free China\") to differentiate it from
        \"Communist China\" (or \"Red China\"). It was a member of the United Nations
        representing \"<i>China</i>\" until 1971, when it lost its seat to the People''s
        Republic of China. Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become
        commonly known as \"Taiwan\", after the island that comprises 99% of the territory
        under its control. In some contexts, especially official ones from the ROC
        government, the name is written as \"Republic of China (Taiwan)\", \"Republic
        of China/Taiwan\", or sometimes \"Taiwan (ROC).\" The Republic of China participates
        in most international forums and organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei\"
        due to diplomatic pressure from the People''s Republic of China. For instance,
        it is the name under which it has competed at the Olympic Games since 1984,
        and its name as an observer at the World Health Organization.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Prehistoric_Taiwan\">Prehistoric
        Taiwan</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Taiwan was joined to the mainland in the Late Pleistocene,
        until sea levels rose about 10,000 years ago. Fragmentary human remains dated
        20,000 to 30,000 years ago have been found on the island, as well as later
        artefacts of a Paleolithic culture.</p>\n<p>Around 6,000 years ago, Taiwan
        was settled by farmers, most likely from mainland China. They are believed
        to be the ancestors of today''s Taiwanese aborigines, whose languages belong
        to the Austronesian language family, but show much greater diversity than
        the rest of the family, which spans a huge area from Maritime Southeast Asia
        west to Madagascar and east as far as New Zealand, Hawaii and Easter Island.
        This has led linguists to propose Taiwan as the urheimat of the family, from
        which seafaring peoples dispersed across Southeast Asia and the Pacific and
        Indian Oceans.</p>\n<p>Han Chinese fishermen began settling in the Penghu
        islands in the 13th century. Hostile tribes, and a lack of valuable trade
        products, meant that few outsiders visited the main island until the 16th
        century. By the 1700''s visits to the coast by fishermen from Fujian, as well
        as Chinese and Japanese pirates, became more frequent.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Opening_in_the_17th_century\">Opening
        in the 17th century</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The Dutch East India Company attempted
        to establish a trading outpost on the Penghu Islands (Pescadores) in 1622,
        but were militarily defeated and driven off by the Ming authorities.</p>\n<p>In
        1624, the company established a stronghold called Fort Zeelandia on the coastal
        islet of Tayouan, which is now part of the main island at Anping, Tainan.
        David Wright, a Scottish agent of the company who lived on the island in the
        1650s, described the lowland areas of the island as being divided among 11
        chiefdoms ranging in size from two settlements to 72. Some of these fell under
        Dutch control, while others remained independent. The Company began to import
        labourers from Fujian and Penghu (Pescadores), many of whom settled.</p>\n<p>In
        1626, the Spanish Empire landed on and occupied northern Taiwan, at the ports
        of Keelung and Tamsui, as a base to extend their trading. This colonial period
        lasted 16 years until 1642, when the last Spanish fortress fell to Dutch forces.</p>\n<p>Following
        the fall of the Ming dynasty, Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), a self-styled Ming
        loyalist, arrived on the island and captured Fort Zeelandia in 1662, expelling
        the Dutch Empire and military from the island. Koxinga established the Kingdom
        of Tungning (1662\u20131683), with his capital at Tainan. He and his heirs,
        Zheng Jing, who ruled from 1662 to 1682, and Zheng Keshuang, who ruled less
        than a year, continued to launch raids on the southeast coast of mainland
        China well into the Qing dynasty era.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Qing_rule\">Qing
        rule</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>In 1683, following the defeat of Koxinga''s grandson
        by an armada led by Admiral Shi Lang of southern Fujian, the Qing dynasty
        formally annexed Taiwan, placing it under the jurisdiction of Fujian province.
        The Qing imperial government tried to reduce piracy and vagrancy in the area,
        issuing a series of edicts to manage immigration and respect aboriginal land
        rights. Immigrants mostly from southern Fujian continued to enter Taiwan.
        The border between taxpaying lands and \"savage\" lands shifted eastward,
        with some aborigines becoming sinicized while others retreated into the mountains.
        During this time, there were a number of conflicts between groups of Han Chinese
        from different regions of southern Fujian, particularly between those from
        Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, and between southern Fujian Chinese and aborigines.</p>\n<p>Northern
        Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were the scene of subsidiary campaigns in the
        Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885). The French occupied Keelung on
        1 October 1884, but were repulsed from Tamsui a few days later. The French
        won some tactical victories but were unable to exploit them, and the Keelung
        Campaign ended in stalemate. The Pescadores Campaign, beginning on 31 March
        1885, was a French victory, but had no long-term consequences. The French
        evacuated both Keelung and the Penghu archipelago after the end of the war.</p>\n<p>In
        1887, the Qing upgraded the island''s administration from Taiwan Prefecture
        of Fujian to Fujian-Taiwan-Province (\u798f\u5efa\u81fa\u7063\u7701), the
        twentieth in the empire, with its capital at Taipei. This was accompanied
        by a modernization drive that included building China''s first railroad.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Japanese_rule\">Japanese rule</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>As the Qing dynasty
        was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895), Taiwan, along
        with Penghu and Liaodong Peninsula, were ceded in full sovereignty to the
        Empire of Japan by the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Inhabitants on Taiwan and Penghu
        wishing to remain Qing subjects were given a two-year grace period to sell
        their property and move to mainland China. Very few Taiwanese saw this as
        feasible. On 25 May 1895, a group of pro-Qing high officials proclaimed the
        Republic of Formosa to resist impending Japanese rule. Japanese forces entered
        the capital at Tainan and quelled this resistance on 21 October 1895. Guerrilla
        fighting continued periodically until about 1902 and ultimately took the lives
        of 14,000 Taiwanese, or 0.5% of the population. Several subsequent rebellions
        against the Japanese (the Beipu uprising of 1907, the Tapani incident of 1915,
        and the Musha incident of 1930) were all unsuccessful but demonstrated opposition
        to Japanese colonial rule.</p>\n<p>Japanese colonial rule was instrumental
        in the industrialization of the island, extending the railroads and other
        transportation networks, building an extensive sanitation system, and establishing
        a formal education system. Japanese rule ended the practice of headhunting.
        During this period the human and natural resources of Taiwan were used to
        aid the development of Japan and the production of cash crops such as rice
        and sugar greatly increased. By 1939, Taiwan was the seventh greatest sugar
        producer in the world. Still, the Taiwanese and aborigines were classified
        as second- and third-class citizens. After suppressing Chinese guerrillas
        in the first decade of their rule, Japanese authorities engaged in a series
        of bloody campaigns against the mountain aboriginals, culminating in the Musha
        Incident of 1930. Intellectuals and laborers who participated in left-wing
        movements within Taiwan were also arrested and massacred (e.g. Tsi\u00fann
        U\u012b-Su\u00ed(\u8523\u6e2d\u6c34), Masanosuke Watanabe (\u6e21\u8fba\u653f\u4e4b\u8f85)).</p>\n<p>Around
        1935, the Japanese began an island-wide assimilation project to bind the island
        more firmly to the Japanese Empire and people were taught to see themselves
        as Japanese under the Kominka Movement, during which time Taiwanese culture
        and religion were outlawed and the citizens were encouraged to adopt Japanese
        surnames. The \"South Strike Group\" was based at the Taihoku Imperial University
        in Taipei. During World War II, tens of thousands of Taiwanese served in the
        Japanese military. For example, former ROC President Lee Teng-hui''s elder
        brother served in the Japanese navy and was killed in action in the Philippines
        in February 1945. The Imperial Japanese Navy operated heavily out of Taiwanese
        ports. In October 1944, the Formosa Air Battle was fought between American
        carriers and Japanese forces based in Taiwan. Important Japanese military
        bases and industrial centres throughout Taiwan, like Kaohsiung, were targets
        of heavy American bombings. Also during this time, over 2,000 women were forced
        into sexual slavery for Imperial Japanese troops, now euphemistically called
        \"comfort women.\"</p>\n<p>In 1938, there were 309,000 Japanese settlers in
        Taiwan. After World War II, most of the Japanese were expelled and sent to
        Japan.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Republic_of_China\">Republic of China</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During
        Japanese rule of Taiwan, on 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was declared
        with Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (the KMT or Nationalist Party) was proclaimed
        provisional president following the Xinhai Revolution, which itself began
        with the Wuchang Uprising on 10 October 1911, overthrowing the Qing Dynasty
        and ending over two thousand years of imperial rule in China. However, the
        presidency was later given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general who in 1915
        proclaimed himself Emperor of China. In the face of popular condemnation and
        opposition from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to abdicate and re-establish
        the republic.</p>\n<p>Since its founding until 1949 it was based on mainland
        China. Central authority waxed and waned in response to warlordism (1915\u201328)
        after Yuan Shikai''s death in 1916,, Japanese invasion (1937\u201345), and
        the Chinese Civil War (1927\u201349), with central authority strongest during
        the Nanjing Decade (1927\u201337), when most of China came under the control
        of the Kuomintang (KMT) under an authoritarian one-party state.</p>\n<p>After
        the Surrender of Japan, on 25 October 1945, the US Navy ferried ROC troops
        to Taiwan in order to accept the formal surrender of Japanese military forces
        in Taipei on behalf of the Allied Powers, as part of General Order No. 1 for
        temporary military occupation. General Rikichi And\u014d, governor-general
        of Taiwan and commander-in-chief of all Japanese forces on the island, signed
        the receipt and handed it over to General Chen Yi of the ROC military to complete
        the official turnover. Chen Yi proclaimed that day to be \"Taiwan Retrocession
        Day\", but the Allies considered Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to be under
        military occupation and still under Japanese sovereignty until 1952, when
        the Treaty of San Francisco took effect. Although the 1943 Cairo Declaration
        had envisaged returning these territories to China, in the Treaty of San Francisco
        and Treaty of Taipei Japan has renounced all claim to them without specifying
        to what country they were to be surrendered. This introduced the problem of
        the legal status of Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The ROC administration of Taiwan under
        Chen Yi was strained by increasing tensions between Taiwanese-born people
        and newly arrived mainlanders, which were compounded by economic woes, such
        as hyperinflation. Furthermore, cultural and linguistic conflicts between
        the two groups quickly led to the loss of popular support for the new government,
        while the mass movement led by the working committee of the Communist Party
        also aimed to bring down the Kuomintang government. The shooting of a civilian
        on 28 February 1947 triggered island-wide unrest, which was suppressed with
        military force in what is now called the February 28 Incident. Mainstream
        estimates of the number killed range from 18,000 to 30,000. Those killed were
        mainly members of the Taiwanese elite.</p>\n\n<p>After the end of World War
        II, the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Chinese Nationalists (Kuomintang),
        led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong.
        Throughout the months of 1949, a series of Chinese Communist offensives led
        to the capture of its capital Nanjing on 23 April and the subsequent defeat
        of the Nationalist army on the mainland, and the Communists founded the People''s
        Republic of China on 1 October.</p>\n<p>On 7 December 1949, after the loss
        of four capitals, Chiang evacuated his Nationalist government to Taiwan and
        made Taipei the temporary capital of the ROC (also called the \"wartime capital\"
        by Chiang Kai-shek). Some 2 million people, consisting mainly of soldiers,
        members of the ruling Kuomintang and intellectual and business elites, were
        evacuated from mainland China to Taiwan at that time, adding to the earlier
        population of approximately six million. In addition, the ROC government took
        to Taipei many national treasures and much of China''s gold reserves and foreign
        currency reserves.</p>\n<p>After losing most of the mainland, the Kuomintang
        held remaining control of Tibet, the portions of Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Yunnan
        provinces along with the Hainan Island until 1951 before the Communists subsequently
        captured both territories. From this point onwards, the Kuomintang''s territory
        was reduced to Taiwan, Penghu, the portions of the Fujian province (Kinmen
        and Matsu Islands), and two major islands of Dongsha Islands and Nansha Islands.
        The Kuomintang continued to claim sovereignty over all \"China\", which it
        defined to include mainland China, Taiwan, Outer Mongolia and other areas.
        On mainland China, the victorious Communists claimed they ruled the sole and
        only China (which they claimed included Taiwan) and that the Republic of China
        no longer existed.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"Chinese_Nationalist_one-party_rule\">Chinese
        Nationalist one-party rule</span></h4>\n<p>Martial law, declared on Taiwan
        in May 1949, continued to be in effect after the central government relocated
        to Taiwan. It was not repealed until 1987, and was used as a way to suppress
        the political opposition in the intervening years. During the White Terror,
        as the period is known, 140,000 people were imprisoned or executed for being
        perceived as anti-KMT or pro-Communist. Many citizens were arrested, tortured,
        imprisoned and executed for their real or perceived link to the Communists.
        Since these people were mainly from the intellectual and social elite, an
        entire generation of political and social leaders was decimated. In 1998 law
        was passed to create the \"Compensation Foundation for Improper Verdicts\"
        which oversaw compensation to White Terror victims and families. President
        Ma Ying-jeou made an official apology in 2008, expressing hope that there
        will never be a tragedy similar to White Terror.</p>\n<p>Initially, the United
        States abandoned the KMT and expected that Taiwan would fall to the Communists.
        However, in 1950 the conflict between North Korea and South Korea, which had
        been ongoing since the Japanese withdrawal in 1945, escalated into full-blown
        war, and in the context of the Cold War, US President Harry S. Truman intervened
        again and dispatched the US Navy''s 7th Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent
        hostilities between Taiwan and mainland China. In the Treaty of San Francisco
        and the Treaty of Taipei, which came into force respectively on 28 April 1952
        and 5 August 1952, Japan formally renounced all right, claim and title to
        Taiwan and Penghu, and renounced all treaties signed with China before 1942.
        Neither treaty specified to whom sovereignty over the islands should be transferred,
        because the United States and the United Kingdom disagreed on whether the
        ROC or the PRC was the legitimate government of China. Continuing conflict
        of the Chinese Civil War through the 1950s, and intervention by the United
        States notably resulted in legislation such as the Sino-American Mutual Defense
        Treaty and the Formosa Resolution of 1955.</p>\n\n<p>As the Chinese Civil
        War continued without truce, the government built up military fortifications
        throughout Taiwan. Within this effort, KMT veterans built the now famous Central
        Cross-Island Highway through the Taroko Gorge in the 1950s. The two sides
        would continue to engage in sporadic military clashes with seldom publicized
        details well into the 1960s on the China coastal islands with an unknown number
        of night raids. During the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in September 1958,
        Taiwan''s landscape saw Nike-Hercules missile batteries added, with the formation
        of the 1st Missile Battalion Chinese Army that would not be deactivated until
        1997. Newer generations of missile batteries have since replaced the Nike
        Hercules systems throughout the island.</p>\n<p>During the 1960s and 1970s,
        the ROC maintained an authoritarian, single-party government while its economy
        became industrialized and technology oriented. This rapid economic growth,
        known as the Taiwan Miracle, was the result of a fiscal regime independent
        from mainland China and backed up, among others, by the support of US funds
        and demand for Taiwanese products. In the 1970s, Taiwan was economically the
        second fastest growing state in Asia after Japan. Taiwan, along with Hong
        Kong, South Korea and Singapore, became known as one of the Four Asian Tigers.
        Because of the Cold War, most Western nations and the United Nations regarded
        the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China until the 1970s. Later,
        especially after the termination of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty,
        most nations switched diplomatic recognition to the PRC (see United Nations
        General Assembly Resolution 2758).</p>\n<p>Up until the 1970s, the government
        was regarded by Western critics as undemocratic for upholding martial law,
        for severely repressing any political opposition and for controlling media.
        The KMT did not allow the creation of new parties and those that existed did
        not seriously compete with the KMT. Thus, competitive democratic elections
        did not exist. From the late 1970s to the 1990s, however, Taiwan went through
        reforms and social changes that transformed it from an authoritarian state
        to a democracy. In 1979, a pro-democracy protest known as the Kaohsiung Incident
        took place in Kaohsiung to celebrate Human Rights Day. Although the protest
        was rapidly crushed by the authorities, it is today considered as the main
        event that united Taiwan''s opposition.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Democratization\">Democratization</span></h4>\n\n<p>Chiang
        Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek''s son and successor as the president, began to
        liberalize the political system in the mid-1980s. In 1984, the younger Chiang
        selected Lee Teng-hui, a Taiwanese-born, US-educated technocrat, to be his
        vice-president. In 1986, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was formed
        and inaugurated as the first opposition party in the ROC to counter the KMT.
        A year later, Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law on the main island of Taiwan
        (martial law was lifted on Penghu in 1979, Matsu island in 1992 and Kinmen
        island in 1993). With the advent of democratization, the issue of the political
        status of Taiwan gradually resurfaced as a controversial issue where, previously,
        the discussion of anything other than unification under the ROC was taboo.</p>\n<p>After
        the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, Lee Teng-hui succeeded him
        as president. Lee continued to democratize the government and decrease the
        concentration of government authority in the hands of mainland Chinese. Under
        Lee, Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which Taiwanese culture
        and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint in contrast to earlier
        KMT policies which had promoted a Chinese identity. Lee''s reforms included
        printing banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of
        Taiwan, and streamlining the Taiwan Provincial Government with most of its
        functions transferred to the Executive Yuan. Under Lee, the original members
        of the Legislative Yuan and National Assembly(a former supreme legislative
        body defunct in 2005\uff09, elected in 1947 to represent mainland Chinese
        constituencies and having held the seats without re-election for more than
        four decades, were forced to resign in 1991. The previously nominal representation
        in the Legislative Yuan was brought to an end, reflecting the reality that
        the ROC had no jurisdiction over mainland China, and vice versa. Restrictions
        on the use of Taiwanese Hokkien in the broadcast media and in schools were
        also lifted.</p>\n\n<p>Democratic reforms continued in the 1990s, with Lee
        Teng-hui re-elected in 1996, in the first direct presidential election in
        the history of the ROC. During the later years of Lee''s administration, he
        was involved in corruption controversies relating to government release of
        land and weapons purchase, although no legal proceedings commenced. In 1997,\"To
        meet the requisites of the nation prior to national unification\", the Additional
        Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China was passed and then
        the former \"constitution of five powers\" turns to be more tripartite. In
        2000, Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party was elected as the
        first non-Kuomintang (KMT) President and was re-elected to serve his second
        and last term since 2004. Polarized politics has emerged in Taiwan with the
        formation of the Pan-Blue Coalition of parties led by the KMT, favouring eventual
        Chinese reunification, and the Pan-Green Coalition of parties led by the DPP,
        favouring an eventual and official declaration of Taiwanese independence.
        In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian remarked: \u201cThe National Unification
        Council will cease to function. No budget will be ear-marked for it and its
        personnel must return to their original posts...The National Unification Guidelines
        will cease to apply.\"</p>\n\n<p>On 30 September 2007, the ruling DPP approved
        a resolution asserting a separate identity from China and called for the enactment
        of a new constitution for a \"normal country\". It also called for general
        use of \"Taiwan\" as the country''s name, without abolishing its formal name,
        the Republic of China. The Chen administration also pushed for referendums
        on national defence and UN entry in the 2004 and 2008 elections, which failed
        due to voter turnout below the required legal threshold of 50% of all registered
        voters. The Chen administration was dogged by public concerns over reduced
        economic growth, legislative gridlock due to a pan-blue, opposition-controlled
        Legislative Yuan and corruption involving the First Family as well as government
        officials.</p>\n<p>The KMT increased its majority in the Legislative Yuan
        in the January 2008 legislative elections, while its nominee Ma Ying-jeou
        went on to win the presidency in March of the same year, campaigning on a
        platform of increased economic growth and better ties with the PRC under a
        policy of \"mutual nondenial\". Ma took office on 20 May 2008, the same day
        that President Chen Shui-bian stepped down and was notified by prosecutors
        of possible corruption charges. Part of the rationale for campaigning for
        closer economic ties with the PRC stems from the strong economic growth China
        attained since joining the World Trade Organization. However, some analysts
        say that despite the election of Ma Ying-jeou, the diplomatic and military
        tensions with the PRC have not been reduced.</p>\n<p>On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional
        Court ruled that current marriage laws are unconstitutional and that same-sex
        couples in the Taiwanese LGBT community should have the right to marry. The
        court has given the Legislative Yuan two years to adequately amend Taiwanese
        marriage laws. According to the court ruling, if amendments are not passed
        within two years, same-sex marriages will automatically become legal in Taiwan.</p>\n<h2><span

        China Sea lies to the north, the Philippine Sea to the east, the Bashi Channel
        of the Luzon Strait directly to the south, and the South China Sea to the
        southwest. Its shape is similar to a sweet potato, giving rise to the name
        <i>sweet potato</i> used by Taiwanese Hokkien speakers for people of Taiwanese
        descent.</p>\n<p>The island is characterized by the contrast between the eastern
        two-thirds, consisting mostly of rugged mountains running in five ranges from
        the northern to the southern tip of the island, and the flat to gently rolling
        Chianan Plains in the west that are also home to most of Taiwan''s population.
        Taiwan''s highest point is Yu Shan (Jade Mountain) at 3,952 metres (12,966\u00a0ft),

        lies on the Tropic of Cancer, and its general climate is marine tropical.
        The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical
        and the mountainous regions are temperate. The average rainfall is 2,600 millimetres
        (100 inches) per year for the island proper; the rainy season is concurrent
        with the onset of the summer East Asian Monsoon in May and June. The entire
        island experiences hot, humid weather from June through September. Typhoons
        are most common in July, August and September. During the winter (November
        to March), the northeast experiences steady rain, while the central and southern
        parts of the island are mostly sunny.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Geology\">Geology</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        island of Taiwan lies in a complex tectonic area between the Yangtze Plate
        to the west and north, the Okinawa Plate on the north-east, and the Philippine
        Mobile Belt on the east and south. The upper part of the crust on the island
        is primarily made up of a series of terranes, mostly old island arcs which
        have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the Eurasian
        Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. These have been further uplifted as a
        result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was subducted
        beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust
        under Taiwan more buoyant.</p>\n<p>The east and south of Taiwan are a complex
        system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between
        the North Luzon Trough portion of the Luzon Volcanic Arc and South China,
        where accreted portions of the Luzon Arc and Luzon forearc form the eastern
        Coastal Range and parallel inland Longitudinal Valley of Taiwan respectively.</p>\n<p>The
        major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between
        the various terranes. These have produced major quakes throughout the history
        of the island. On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the \"921 earthquake\"
        killed more than 2,400 people. The seismic hazard map for Taiwan by the USGS
        shows 9/10 of the island as the highest rating (most hazardous).</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Political_and_legal_status\">Political and legal status</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The
        political and legal statuses of Taiwan are contentious issues. The People''s
        Republic of China (PRC) claims that the Republic of China government is illegitimate,
        referring to it as the \"Taiwan Authority\" even though current ROC territories
        have never been controlled by the PRC. The ROC has its own constitution, independently
        elected president and armed forces. It has not formally renounced its claim
        to the mainland, but ROC government publications have increasingly downplayed
        it.</p>\n<p>Internationally, there is controversy on whether the ROC still
        exists as a state or a defunct state per international law due to the lack
        of wide diplomatic recognition. In a poll of Taiwanese aged 20 and older taken
        by TVBS in March 2009, a majority of 64% opted for the \"status quo\", while
        19% favoured \"independence\" and 5% favoured \"unification\".</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Relations_with_the_PRC\">Relations with the PRC</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        political environment is complicated by the potential for military conflict
        should Taiwan declare de jure independence; it is the official PRC policy
        to use force to ensure unification if peaceful unification is no longer possible,
        as stated in its anti-secession law, and for this reason there are substantial
        military installations on the Fujian coast.</p>\n<p>On 29 April 2005, Kuomintang
        Chairman Lien Chan travelled to Beijing and met with Communist Party of China
        (CPC) Secretary-General Hu Jintao, the first meeting between the leaders of
        the two parties since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. On 11 February
        2014, Mainland Affairs Council Head Wang Yu-chi travelled to Nanjing and met
        with Taiwan Affairs Office Head Zhang Zhijun, the first meeting between high-ranking
        officials from either side. Zhang paid a reciprocal visit to Taiwan and met
        Wang on 25 June 2014, making Zhang the first minister-level PRC official to
        ever visit Taiwan. On 7 November 2015, Ma Ying-jeou (in his capacity as <i>Leader
        of Taiwan</i>) and Xi Jinping (in his capacity as <i>Leader of Mainland China</i>)
        travelled to Singapore and met up, marking the highest-level exchange between
        the two sides since 1949.</p>\n<p>The PRC supports a version of the One-China
        policy, which states that Taiwan and mainland China are both part of China,
        and that the PRC is the only legitimate government of China. It uses this
        policy to prevent the international recognition of the ROC as an independent
        sovereign state, meaning that Taiwan participates in international forums
        under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". With the emergence of the Taiwanese independence
        movement, the name \"Taiwan\" has been employed increasingly often on the
        island.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Foreign_relations\">Foreign relations</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before
        1928, the foreign policy of Republican China was complicated by a lack of
        internal unity\u2014competing centres of power all claimed legitimacy. This
        situation changed after the defeat of the Peiyang Government by the Kuomintang,
        which led to widespread diplomatic recognition of the Republic of China.</p>\n<p>After
        the KMT''s retreat to Taiwan, most countries, notably the countries in the
        Western Bloc, continued to maintain relations with the ROC. Due to diplomatic
        pressure, recognition gradually eroded and many countries switched recognition
        to the PRC in the 1970s. UN Resolution 2758 (25 October 1971) recognized the
        People''s Republic of China as China''s sole representative in the United
        Nations.</p>\n<p>The PRC refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation
        that recognizes the ROC, and requires all nations with which it has diplomatic
        relations to make a statement recognizing its claims to Taiwan. As a result,
        only 19\u00a0UN member states and the Holy See maintain official diplomatic
        relations with the Republic of China. The ROC maintains unofficial relations
        with most countries via <i>de facto</i> embassies and consulates called Taipei
        Economic and Cultural Representative Offices (TECRO), with branch offices
        called \"Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices\" (TECO). Both TECRO and TECO
        are \"unofficial commercial entities\" of the ROC in charge of maintaining
        diplomatic relations, providing consular services (i.e. visa applications),
        and serving the national interests of the ROC in other countries.</p>\n<p>The
        United States remains one of the main allies of the country and, through the
        Taiwan Relations Act passed in 1979, has continued selling arms and providing
        military training to the Armed Forces. This situation continues to be an issue
        for the People''s Republic of China which considers US involvement disruptive
        to the stability of the region. In January 2010, the Obama administration
        announced its intention to sell $6.4 billion worth of military hardware to
        Taiwan. As a consequence, the PRC threatened the US with economic sanctions
        and warned that their co-operation on international and regional issues could
        suffer.</p>\n<p>The official position of the United States is that the PRC
        is expected to \"use no force or threat[en] to use force against Taiwan\"
        and the ROC is to \"exercise prudence in managing all aspects of Cross-Strait
        relations.\" Both are to refrain from performing actions or espousing statements
        \"that would unilaterally alter Taiwan''s status.\"</p>\n<p>On 16 December
        2015, the Obama administration announced a deal to sell $1.83 billion worth
        of arms to the armed forces of the ROC. China''s foreign ministry had expressed
        its disapproval for the sales and issued the US a \"stern warning\", saying
        it would hurt China\u2013US relations.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Participation_in_international_events_and_organizations\">Participation
        in international events and organizations</span></h3>\n\n<p>The ROC was a
        founding member of the United Nations, and held the seat of China on the Security
        Council and other UN bodies until 1971, when it was expelled by Resolution
        2758 and replaced in all UN organs with the PRC. Each year since 1992, the
        ROC has petitioned the UN for entry, but its applications have not made it
        past committee.</p>\n\n<p>Due to its limited international recognition, the
        Republic of China is a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization,
        represented by a government-funded organization, the Taiwan Foundation for
        Democracy (TFD) under the name \"Taiwan\".</p>\n<p>Also due to its One China
        policy, the PRC only participates in international organizations where the
        ROC is not recognized as a sovereign country. Most member states, including
        the United States, do not wish to discuss the issue of the ROC''s political
        status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the PRC. However, both the
        US and Japan publicly support the ROC''s bid for membership in the World Health
        Organization as an observer. However, though the ROC sought to participate
        in the WHO since 1997, their efforts were blocked by the PRC until 2010, when
        they were invited as observers to attend the World Health Assembly, under
        the name \"Chinese Taipei\".</p>\n<p>Due to PRC pressure, the ROC is forced
        to use the name \"Chinese Taipei\" in international events, such as the Olympic
        Games, where the PRC is also a party. The ROC is typically barred from using
        its national anthem and national flag in international events due to PRC pressure;
        ROC spectators attending events such as the Olympics are often barred from
        bringing ROC flags into venues. Taiwan also participates in the Asia-Pacific
        Economic Cooperation forum (since 1991) and the World Trade Organization (since
        2002) under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". The ROC is able to participate as
        \"China\" in organizations that the PRC does not participate in, such as the
        World Organization of the Scout Movement.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Opinions_within_Taiwan\">Opinions
        within Taiwan</span></h3>\n\n<p>Within Taiwan, opinions are polarized between
        those supporting unification, represented by the Pan-Blue Coalition of parties,
        and those supporting independence, represented by the Pan-Green Coalition.</p>\n<p>The
        KMT, the largest Pan-Blue party, supports the status quo for the indefinite
        future with a stated ultimate goal of unification. However, it does not support
        unification in the short term with the PRC as such a prospect would be unacceptable
        to most of its members and the public. Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the KMT and
        former president of the ROC, has set out democracy, economic development to
        a level near that of Taiwan, and equitable wealth distribution as the conditions
        that the PRC must fulfill for reunification to occur.</p>\n<p>The Democratic
        Progressive Party, the largest Pan-Green party, officially seeks independence,
        but in practice also supports the status quo because its members and the public
        would not accept the risk of provoking the PRC.</p>\n<p>On 2 September 2008,
        Mexican newspaper <i>El Sol de M\u00e9xico</i> asked President Ma about his
        views on the subject of \"two Chinas\" and if there was a solution for the
        sovereignty issues between the two. The president replied that the relations
        are neither between two Chinas nor two states. It is a special relationship.
        Further, he stated that the sovereignty issues between the two cannot be resolved
        at present, but he quoted the \"1992 Consensus\", currently accepted by both
        the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China, as a temporary measure until
        a solution becomes available.</p>\n<p>On 27 September 2017, Taiwanese premier
        William Lai said that he was a \u201cpolitical worker who advocates Taiwan
        independence\u201d, but that as Taiwan was an independent country called the
        Republic of China, it had no need to declare independence. The relationship
        with the PRC and the related issues of Taiwanese independence and Chinese
        unification continue to dominate politics.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Government_and_politics\">Government
        and politics</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The government of the Republic of China
        was founded on the Constitution of the ROC and its Three Principles of the
        People, which states that the ROC \"shall be a democratic republic of the
        people, to be governed by the people and for the people.\" The government
        is divided into five branches (<i>Yuan</i>): the Executive Yuan (cabinet),
        the Legislative Yuan (Congress or Parliament), the Judicial Yuan, the Control
        Yuan (audit agency), and the Examination Yuan (civil service examination agency).
        The constitution was drafted before the fall of mainland China to the Communist
        Party of China. It was created by the KMT for the purpose of all of its claimed
        territory, including Taiwan, even though the Communist Party boycotted the
        drafting of the constitution. The constitution went into effect on 25 December
        1947. The ROC remained under martial law from 1948 until 1987 and much of
        the constitution was not in effect. Political reforms beginning in the late
        1970s and continuing through the early 1990s liberalized the country and transformed
        into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic
        of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components
        that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment
        continues. In 2000, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidency,
        ending KMT''s continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National
        Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement
        several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National
        Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of
        constitutional reform to the popular ballot.</p>\n<p>The head of state and
        commander-in-chief of the armed forces is the president, who is elected by
        popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the
        vice-president. The president has authority over the Yuan. The president appoints
        the members of the Executive Yuan as his cabinet, including a premier, who
        is officially the President of the Executive Yuan; members are responsible
        for policy and administration.</p>\n<p>The main legislative body is the unicameral
        Legislative Yuan with 113 seats. Seventy-three are elected by popular vote
        from single-member constituencies; thirty-four are elected based on the proportion
        of nationwide votes received by participating political parties in a separate
        party list ballot; and six are elected from two three-member aboriginal constituencies.
        Members serve four-year terms. Originally the unicameral National Assembly,
        as a standing constitutional convention and electoral college, held some parliamentary
        functions, but the National Assembly was abolished in 2005 with the power
        of constitutional amendments handed over to the Legislative Yuan and all eligible
        voters of the Republic via referendums.</p>\n<p>The premier is selected by
        the president without the need for approval from the legislature, but the
        legislature can pass laws without regard for the president, as neither he
        nor the Premier wields veto power. Thus, there is little incentive for the
        president and the legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing
        parties. After the election of the pan-Green''s Chen Shui-bian as President
        in 2000, legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the Legislative
        Yuan, which was controlled by a pan-Blue majority. Historically, the ROC has
        been dominated by strongman single party politics. This legacy has resulted
        in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the president
        rather than the premier, even though the constitution does not explicitly
        state the extent of the president''s executive power.</p>\n<p>The Judicial
        Yuan is the highest judicial organ. It interprets the constitution and other
        laws and decrees, judges administrative suits, and disciplines public functionaries.
        The president and vice-president of the Judicial Yuan and additional thirteen
        justices form the Council of Grand Justices. They are nominated and appointed
        by the president, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The highest court,
        the Supreme Court, consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each
        of which is formed by a presiding judge and four associate judges, all appointed
        for life. In 1993, a separate constitutional court was established to resolve
        constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and
        accelerate the democratization process. There is no trial by jury but the
        right to a fair public trial is protected by law and respected in practice;
        many cases are presided over by multiple judges.</p>\n\n<p>Capital punishment
        is still used in Taiwan, although efforts have been made by the government
        to reduce the number of executions. Nevertheless, according to a survey in
        2006, about 80% of Taiwanese still wanted to keep the death penalty.</p>\n<p>The
        Control Yuan is a watchdog agency that monitors (controls) the actions of
        the executive. It can be considered a standing commission for administrative
        inquiry and can be compared to the Court of Auditors of the European Union
        or the Government Accountability Office of the United States.</p>\n<p>The
        Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants.
        It is based on the old imperial examination system used in dynastic China.
        It can be compared to the European Personnel Selection Office of the European
        Union or the Office of Personnel Management of the United States.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Major_camps\">Major camps</span></h3>\n\n<p>The tension between China
        and Taiwan colours most of the political life, and any government move towards
        \"Taiwan independence\" is met by threat of military attack from the PRC.
        The PRC''s official policy is to reunify Taiwan and mainland China under the
        formula of \"one country, two systems\" and refuses to renounce the use of
        military force, especially should Taiwan seek a declaration of independence.</p>\n<p>The
        political scene is generally divided into two major camps in terms of views
        on how Taiwan should relate to China or the PRC, referred to as cross-Strait
        relations. It is the main political difference between two camps: the Pan-Blue
        Coalition, composed of the pro-unification Kuomintang, People First Party
        (PFP), and New Party, who believe that the ROC is the sole legitimate government
        of \"China\" (including Taiwan) and supports eventual Chinese reunification.
        The opposition Pan-Green Coalition is composed of the pro-independence DPP
        and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU). It regards Taiwan as an independent, sovereign
        state synonymous with the ROC, opposes the definition that Taiwan is part
        of \"China\", and seeks wide diplomatic recognition and an eventual declaration
        of formal Taiwan independence. The Pan-Green camp tends to favour emphasizing
        the Republic of China as being a distinct country from the People''s Republic
        of China. Thus, in September 2007, the then ruling Democratic Progressive
        Party approved a resolution asserting separate identity from China and called
        for the enactment of a new constitution for a \"<i>normal country</i>\". It
        called also for general use of \"<i>Taiwan</i>\" as the country''s name, without
        abolishing its formal name, the \"Republic of China\". Some members of the
        coalition, such as former President Chen Shui-bian, argue that it is unnecessary
        to proclaim independence because \"Taiwan is already an independent, sovereign
        country\" and the Republic of China is the same as Taiwan. Despite being a
        member of KMT prior to and during his presidency, Lee Teng-hui also held a
        similar view and was a supporter of the Taiwanization movement.</p>\n<p>Pan-Blue
        members generally support the concept of the One-China policy, which states
        that there is only one China and that its only government is the ROC. They
        favour eventual re-unification of China. The more mainstream Pan-Blue position
        is to lift investment restrictions and pursue negotiations with the PRC to
        immediately open direct transportation links. Regarding independence, the
        mainstream Pan-Blue position is to maintain the status quo, while refusing
        immediate reunification. President Ma Ying-jeou stated that there will be
        no unification nor declaration of independence during his presidency. As of
        2009, Pan-Blue members usually seek to improve relationships with mainland
        China, with a current focus on improving economic ties.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Current_political_issues\">Current
        political issues</span></h3>\n<p>The dominant political issue in Taiwan is
        its relationship with the PRC. For almost 60\u00a0years, there were no direct
        transportation links, including direct flights, between Taiwan and mainland
        China. This was a problem for many Taiwanese businesses that had opened factories
        or branches in mainland China. The former DPP administration feared that such
        links would lead to tighter economic and political integration with mainland
        China, and in the 2006 Lunar New Year Speech, President Chen Shui-bian called
        for managed opening of links. Direct weekend charter flights between Taiwan
        and mainland China began in July 2008 under the current KMT government, and
        the first direct daily charter flights took off in December 2008.</p>\n<p>Other
        major political issues include the passage of an arms procurement bill that
        the United States authorized in 2001. In 2008, however, the United States
        was reluctant to send over more arms to Taiwan out of fear that it would hinder
        the recent improvement of ties between the PRC and the ROC. Another major
        political issue is the establishment of a National Communications Commission
        to take over from the Government Information Office, whose advertising budget
        exercised great control over the media.</p>\n<p>The politicians and their
        parties have themselves become major political issues. Corruption among some
        DPP administration officials has been exposed. In early 2006, President Chen
        Shui-bian was linked to possible corruption. The political effect on President
        Chen Shui-bian was great, causing a divide in the DPP leadership and supporters
        alike. It eventually led to the creation of a political camp led by ex-DPP
        leader Shih Ming-teh which believes the president should resign. The KMT assets
        continue to be another major issue, as it was once the richest political party
        in the world. Nearing the end of 2006, KMT''s chairman Ma Ying-jeou was also
        hit by corruption controversies, although he has since then been cleared of
        any wrongdoings by the courts. After completing his second term as President,
        Chen Shui-bian was charged with corruption and money laundering. Following
        his conviction, he is serving a 17-year sentence in Taipei Prison.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"National_identity\">National identity</span></h3>\n\n<p>Roughly 84% of
        Taiwan''s population descends from Han Chinese who migrated from Qing China
        between 1661 and 1895. Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese
        who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The
        shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical
        separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences,
        as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national
        identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratization
        and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed
        to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart
        of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland
        China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for
        <i>de jure</i> Taiwan independence. The pan-green camp supports a distinct
        Taiwanese identity, while the pan-blue camp supports a Chinese identity only.
        The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a
        Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.</p>\n<p>According to a survey
        conducted in March 2009, 49% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese
        only, and 44% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese and Chinese.
        3% consider themselves as only Chinese. Another survey, conducted in Taiwan
        in July 2009, showed that 82.8% of respondents consider the ROC and the PRC
        as two separate countries with each developing on its own. A survey conducted
        in December 2009 showed that 62% of the respondents consider themselves as
        Taiwanese only, and 22% of the respondents consider themselves as both Taiwanese
        and Chinese. 8% consider themselves as only Chinese. The survey also shows
        that among 18- to 29-year-old respondents, 75% consider themselves as Taiwanese
        only.</p>\n<p>In the latest survey conducted by National Chengchi University
        in 2014 and published in early 2015, 60.6% of respondents identified themselves
        exclusively as Taiwanese, 32.5% identified themselves as both Taiwanese and
        Chinese and 3.5% identified themselves as Chinese.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Military\">Military</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The
        Republic of China Army takes its roots in the National Revolutionary Army,
        which was established by Sun Yat-sen in 1925 in Guangdong with a goal of reunifying
        China under the Kuomintang. When the People''s Liberation Army won the Chinese
        Civil War, much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along
        with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army.
        Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded
        or incorporated into the People''s Liberation Army.</p>\n<p>Today, the Republic
        of China maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as
        defence against the constant threat of invasion by the PRC under the Anti-Secession
        Law of the People''s Republic of China. From 1949 to the 1970s, the primary
        mission of the military was to \"retake the mainland\" through Project National
        Glory. As this mission has shifted to defence, the ROC military has begun
        to shift emphasis from the traditionally dominant Army to the air force and
        navy.</p>\n<p>Control of the armed forces has also passed into the hands of
        the civilian government. As the ROC military shares historical roots with
        the KMT, the older generation of high-ranking officers tends to have Pan-Blue
        sympathies. However, many have retired and there are many more non-mainlanders
        enlisting in the armed forces in the younger generations, so the political
        leanings of the military have moved closer to the public norm in Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The
        ROC began a force reduction program, Jingshi An (translated to streamlining
        program), to scale down its military from a level of 450,000 in 1997 to 380,000
        in 2001. As of 2009, the armed forces of the ROC number approximately 300,000,
        with nominal reserves totalling 3.6\u00a0million as of 2005. Conscription
        remains universal for qualified males reaching age eighteen, but as a part
        of the reduction effort many are given the opportunity to fulfill their draft
        requirement through alternative service and are redirected to government agencies
        or defence related industries. Current plans call for a transition to a predominantly
        professional army over the next decade. Conscription periods are planned to
        decrease from 14\u00a0months to 12. In the last months of the Bush administration,
        Taipei took the decision to reverse the trend of declining defence spending,
        at a time when most Asian countries kept on reducing their military expenditures.
        It also decided to modernize both defensive and offensive capabilities. Taipei
        still keeps a large military apparatus relative to the island''s population:
        defence expenditures for 2008 were NTD 334 billion (approximately US $10.5
        billion), which accounted for 2.94% of GDP.</p>\n\n\n<p>The armed forces''
        primary concern at this time, according to the <i>National Defense Report</i>,
        is the possibility of an invasion by the PRC, consisting of a naval blockade,
        airborne assault, and/or missile bombardment. Four upgraded <i>Kidd</i>-class
        destroyers were purchased from the United States, and commissioned into the
        Republic of China Navy in 2005\u20132006, significantly upgrading Taiwan''s
        air defence and submarine hunting abilities. The Ministry of National Defense
        planned to purchase diesel-powered submarines and Patriot anti-missile batteries
        from the United States, but its budget has been stalled repeatedly by the
        opposition-Pan-Blue Coalition controlled legislature. The defence package
        was stalled from 2001 to 2007 where it was finally passed through the legislature
        and the US responded on 3 October 2008, with a $6.5\u00a0billion arms package
        including PAC III Anti-Air defence systems, AH-64D Apache Attack helicopters
        and other arms and parts. A significant amount of military hardware has been
        bought from the United States, and, as of 2009, continues to be legally guaranteed
        by the Taiwan Relations Act. In the past, France and the Netherlands have
        also sold military weapons and hardware to the ROC, but they almost entirely
        stopped in the 1990s under pressure of the PRC.</p>\n<p>The first line of
        defence against invasion by the PRC is the ROC''s own armed forces. Current
        ROC military doctrine is to hold out against an invasion or blockade until
        the US military responds. There is, however, no guarantee in the Taiwan Relations
        Act or any other treaty that the United States will defend Taiwan, even in
        the event of invasion. The joint declaration on security between the US and
        Japan signed in 1996 may imply that Japan would be involved in any response.
        However, Japan has refused to stipulate whether the \"area surrounding Japan\"
        mentioned in the pact includes Taiwan, and the precise purpose of the pact
        is unclear. The Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS
        Treaty) may mean that other US allies, such as Australia, could theoretically
        be involved. In practice, the risk of losing economic ties with China may
        prevent Australia from taking action. The United States, United Kingdom, Japan,
        South Korea, Australia, Canada, Chile, and Peru conduct maritime exercises
        in the Pacific Ocean every two years called RIMPAC. They are conducted to
        promote stability and to be able to respond in case of an armed conflict in
        the region \u2013 that includes an invasion of Taiwan by China.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Administrative_divisions\">Administrative divisions</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According
        to the 1947 constitution, the territory of the ROC is according to its \"existing
        national boundaries\". According to the Executive Yuan in 2012, Mongolia was
        re-recognized by Republic of China as an independent country when the constitution
        was announced in 1946.</p>\n<p>When the ROC retreated to Taiwan in 1949, its
        claimed territory consisted of 35 provinces, 12 special municipalities, 1
        special administrative region and 2 autonomous regions. However, since its
        retreat, the ROC has controlled only Taiwan Province and some islands of Fujian
        Province. The ROC also controls the Pratas Islands and Taiping Island in the
        Spratly Islands, which are part of the disputed South China Sea Islands. They
        were placed under Kaohsiung administration after the retreat to Taiwan.</p>\n<p>Since
        1949, the government has made some changes in the area under its control.
        Taipei became a special municipality in 1967 and Kaohsiung in 1979. The two
        provincial governments were \"streamlined\", with their functions transferred
        to the central government (Fujian in 1956 and Taiwan in 1998). In 2010, New
        Taipei, Taichung and Tainan were upgraded to special municipalities. And in
        2014, Taoyuan County was also upgraded to Taoyuan special municipality. This
        brought the top-level divisions to their current state:</p>\n<p>According
        to Article 4 of the Local Government Act, laws pertaining to special municipalities
        also apply to counties with a population exceeding 2 million. This provision
        does not currently apply to any county, although it previously applied to
        Taipei County (now New Taipei City) and Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City).</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Economy_and_industry\">Economy and industry</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The quick
        industrialization and rapid growth of Taiwan during the latter half of the
        20th century has been called the \"Taiwan Miracle\". Taiwan is one of the
        \"Four Asian Tigers\" alongside Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.</p>\n<p>Japanese
        rule prior to and during World War II brought changes in the public and private
        sectors, most notably in the area of public works, which enabled rapid communications
        and facilitated transport throughout much of the island. The Japanese also
        improved public education and made it compulsory for all residents of Taiwan.</p>\n<p>By
        1945, hyperinflation was in progress in mainland China and Taiwan as a result
        of the war with Japan. To isolate Taiwan from it, the Nationalist government
        created a new currency area for the island, and began a price stabilization
        program. These efforts significantly slowed inflation.</p>\n<p>When the KMT
        government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of taels (where 1\u00a0tael
        ~1.2\u00a0ozt) of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China,
        which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.
        Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought
        the intellectual and business elites from Mainland China. The KMT government
        instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted
        on mainland China. The government also implemented a policy of import-substitution,
        attempting to produce imported goods domestically.</p>\n<p>In 1950, with the
        outbreak of the Korean War, the United States began an aid program which resulted
        in fully stabilized prices by 1952. Economic development was encouraged by
        American economic aid and programs such as the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction,
        which turned the agricultural sector into the basis for later growth. Under
        the combined stimulus of the land reform and the agricultural development
        programs, agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 4
        per cent from 1952 to 1959, which was greater than the population growth,
        3.6%.</p>\n<p>In 1962, Taiwan had a (nominal) per-capita gross national product
        (GNP) of $170, placing its economy on a par with those of the Democratic Republic
        of the Congo. On a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, its GDP per capita
        in the early 1960s was $1,353 (in 1990 prices). By 2011 per-capita GNP, adjusted
        for purchasing power parity (PPP), had risen to $37,000, contributing to a
        Human Development Index (HDI) equivalent to that of other developed countries.
        Taiwan''s HDI in 2012 is 0.890, (23rd, very high), according to the UN''s
        new \"Inequality-adjusted HDI\" calculation method.</p>\n<p>In 1974, Chiang
        Ching-kuo implemented the Ten Major Construction Projects, the beginning foundations
        that helped Taiwan transform into its current export driven economy. Since
        the 1990s, a number of Taiwan-based technology firms have expanded their reach
        around the world. Well-known international technology companies headquartered
        in Taiwan include personal computer manufacturers Acer Inc. and Asus, mobile
        phone maker HTC, as well as electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn, which
        makes products for Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Computex Taipei is a major
        computer expo, held since 1981.</p>\n\n<p>Today Taiwan has a dynamic, capitalist,
        export-driven economy with gradually decreasing state involvement in investment
        and foreign trade. In keeping with this trend, some large government-owned
        banks and industrial firms are being privatized. Real growth in GDP has averaged
        about 8% during the past three decades. Exports have provided the primary
        impetus for industrialization. The trade surplus is substantial, and foreign
        reserves are the world''s fifth largest. The Republic of China has its own
        currency, the New Taiwan dollar.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the 1990s,
        the economic ties between Taiwan and the People''s Republic of China have
        been very prolific. As of 2008, more than US$150 billion have been invested
        in the PRC by Taiwanese companies, and about 10% of the Taiwanese labour force
        works in the PRC, often to run their own businesses. Although the economy
        of Taiwan benefits from this situation, some have expressed the view that
        the island has become increasingly dependent on the Mainland Chinese economy.
        A 2008 white paper by the Department of Industrial Technology states that
        \"Taiwan should seek to maintain stable relation with China while continuing
        to protect national security, and avoiding excessive ''Sinicization'' of Taiwanese
        economy.\" Others argue that close economic ties between Taiwan and Mainland
        China would make any military intervention by the PLA against Taiwan very
        costly, and therefore less probable.</p>\n<p>Taiwan''s total trade in 2010
        reached an all-time high of US$526.04 billion, according to Taiwan''s Ministry
        of Finance. Both exports and imports for the year reached record levels, totalling
        US$274.64 billion and US$251.4 billion, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, agriculture
        constituted only 2% of GDP, down from 35% in 1952. Traditional labour-intensive
        industries are steadily being moved offshore and with more capital and technology-intensive
        industries replacing them. High-technology industrial parks have sprung up
        in every region in Taiwan. The ROC has become a major foreign investor in
        the PRC, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. It is
        estimated that some 50,000\u00a0Taiwanese businesses and 1,000,000\u00a0businesspeople
        and their dependents are established in the PRC.</p>\n<p>Because of its conservative
        financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little
        compared with many of its neighbours from the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
        Unlike its neighbours, South Korea and Japan, the Taiwanese economy is dominated
        by small and medium-sized businesses, rather than the large business groups.
        The global economic downturn, however, combined with poor policy co-ordination
        by the new administration and increasing bad debts in the banking system,
        pushed Taiwan into recession in 2001, the first whole year of negative growth
        since 1947. Due to the relocation of many manufacturing and labour-intensive
        industries to the PRC, unemployment also reached a level not seen since the
        1970s oil crisis. This became a major issue in the 2004 presidential election.
        Growth averaged more than 4% in the 2002\u20132006 period and the unemployment
        rate fell below 4%.</p>\n<p>The ROC often joins international organizations
        (especially ones that also include the People''s Republic of China) under
        a politically neutral name. The ROC has been a member of governmental trade
        organizations such as the World Trade Organization under the name Separate
        Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei) since
        2002.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Transportation\">Transportation</span></h2>\n\n<p>The
        Ministry of Transportation and Communications of the Republic of China is
        the cabinet-level governing body of the transportation network in Taiwan.
        Taiwan has an extensive highway network, classified into five levels: national
        highways, provincial highways, county routes, township routes, and special
        routes, with the first four being common. Taiwan also has an extensive bus
        network, most of which are run by private bus companies. Inter-city rail services
        are provided by Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) and Taiwan High Speed
        Rail (THSR). Rapid transit systems include the Taipei Metro, Taoyuan Metro
        (incl. the Airport MRT) and Kaohsiung MRT, while Taichung Metro is under construction.
        Major airports include Taiwan Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, Taipei Songshan and Taichung.
        There are currently seven airlines in Taiwan, the largest ones being China
        Airlines and EVA Air. There are four international seaports: Keelung, Kaohsiung,
        Taichung, and Hualien.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Education,_research,_and_academia\"></span><span
        id=\"Education.2C_research.2C_and_academia\">Education, research, and academia</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The
        higher education system was established in Taiwan by Japan during the colonial
        period. However, after the Republic of China took over Taiwan from Japan in
        1945, the system was promptly replaced by the same system as in mainland China
        which mixed with features of the Chinese and American educational systems.</p>\n<p>Taiwan
        is well known for adhering to the Confucian paradigm of valuing education
        as a means to improve one''s socioeconomic position in Taiwanese society.
        Heavy investment and a cultural value for education has catapulted the resource
        poor nation consistently atop the global education rankings. Taiwan is one
        of the top-performing countries in reading literacy, maths and sciences. In
        2015, Taiwanese students achieved one of the world''s best results in mathematics,
        science and literacy, as tested by the Programme for International Student
        Assessment (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils'' scholastic
        performance. The strong scholastic and educational performance of Taiwanese
        students has prompted the nation to build a highly educated labour force that
        possesses a strong background in mathematics and science to cope with the
        current labor market demands of the 21st century.</p>\n<p>The Taiwanese education
        system has been praised for various reasons including its comparatively high
        test results and its major role in ushering Taiwan''s economic development
        while creating one of the world\u2019s most highly educated workforces. The
        country has also been praised for its high university entrance rate where
        the university acceptance rate has increased from around 20 percent before
        the 1970s to 49 percent in 1996 and over 90 percent since 2006, among the
        highest in Asia. The nation''s high university entrance rate has created a
        highly skilled workforce making Taiwan one of the most highly educated countries
        in the world with 68.5% of Taiwanese high school students going on to attend
        university. Taiwan has a high percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary
        education degree where 45 percent of Taiwanese aged 25\u201364 hold a bachelors
        degree or higher compared with the average of 33 percent among member countries
        of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). On the
        other hand, the system has been criticized for placing excessive pressure
        on students and eschewing creativity in favor of rote memorization. In addition,
        the system has been criticized for producing an excess supply of over-educated
        university graduates and a higher unemployment rate. With a large supply of
        university graduates seeking a limited demand of prestigious white collar
        jobs in an environment that is increasingly losing its competitive edge has
        led many degree holders ending up with lower end jobs with salaries far beneath
        than their expectations. Taiwan\u2019s universities have also been under criticism
        for not being able to fully meet the requirements and demands of Taiwan\u2019s
        21st century fast-moving job market citing a skills mismatch among a large
        number of self-assessed overeducated university graduates that don''t fit
        the demands of the modern Taiwanese labor market. The Taiwanese government
        has also been criticized for undermining the economy as it has been unable
        to produce enough jobs to meet the demands of numerous underemployed university
        graduates.</p>\n<p>As the Taiwanese economy is largely science and technology
        based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher
        education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain
        a competitive edge when searching for employment. Although current Taiwanese
        law mandates only nine years of schooling, 95% of junior high graduates go
        on to attend a senior vocational high school, university, junior college,
        trade school, or other higher education institution.</p>\n<p>Many Taiwanese
        students attend cram schools, or bushiban, to improve skills and knowledge
        on problem solving against exams of subjects like mathematics, nature science,
        history and many others. Courses are available for most popular subjects.
        Lessons are organized in lectures, reviews, private tutorial sessions, and
        recitations.</p>\n<p>As of 2013, the literacy rate in Taiwan is 97.15%.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Demographics\">Demographics</span></h2>\n\n<p>Taiwan''s population is
        about 23.4 million, most of whom are on the island proper. The remainder live
        on Penghu (101,758), Kinmen (127,723), and Matsu (12,506).</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Ethnic_groups\">Ethnic groups</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The ROC government
        reports that over 95% of the population is Han, of which the majority includes
        descendants of early Han Chinese immigrants who arrived in Taiwan in large
        numbers starting in the 18th century. Alternatively, the ethnic groups of
        Taiwan may be roughly divided among the Hoklo (70%), the Hakka (14%), the
        Waishengren (14%), and indigenous peoples (2%).</p>\n<p>The Hoklo people are
        the largest Han subgroup (70% of the total population), whose ancestors migrated
        from the coastal southern Fujian region across the Taiwan Strait starting
        in the 17th century. The Hakka comprise about 15% of the total population,
        and descend from Han migrants to Guangdong, its surrounding areas and Taiwan.
        Additional people of Han origin include and descend from the 2 million Nationalists
        who fled to Taiwan following the communist victory on the mainland in 1949.</p>\n<p>The
        indigenous Taiwanese aborigines number about 533,600 and are divided into
        16 recognized groups. The Ami, Atayal, Bunun, Kanakanavu, Kavalan, Paiwan,
        Puyuma, Rukai, Saisiyat, Saaroa, Sakizaya, Sediq, Thao, Truku and Tsou live
        mostly in the eastern half of the island, while the Yami inhabit Orchid Island.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Languages\">Languages</span></h3>\n\n<p>Mandarin is the official national
        language and is spoken by the vast majority of the population of Taiwan. It
        has been the primary language of instruction in schools since the end of Japanese
        rule. As in Hong Kong and Macau, Traditional Chinese is used as the writing
        system in Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The 70% of the population belonging to the Hoklo
        ethnic group speak Taiwanese Hokkien (a variant of the Min Nan speech of Fujian
        province) as their mother tongue, in addition to Mandarin, and many others
        have some degree of understanding. The Hakka ethnic group (15% of the population)
        use Hakka Chinese. Most <i>waishengren</i> speak primarily Mandarin. Although
        Mandarin is the language of instruction in schools and dominates television
        and radio, non-Mandarin Chinese varieties have undergone a revival in public
        life in Taiwan, particularly since restrictions on their use were lifted in
        the 1990s.</p>\n<p>Taiwan''s indigenous languages, the Formosan languages,
        do not belong to the Chinese or Sino-Tibetan language family, but rather to
        the Austronesian language family. Their use among Taiwan''s aboriginal minority
        groups has been in decline as usage of Mandarin has risen. Of the 14 extant
        languages, five are considered moribund.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Religion\">Religion</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        Constitution of the Republic of China protects people''s freedom of religion
        and the practices of belief. There are approximately 18,718,600 religious
        followers in Taiwan as of 2005 (81.3% of total population) and 14\u201318%
        are non-religious. According to the 2005 census, of the 26 religions recognized
        by the ROC government, the five largest are: Buddhism (8,086,000 or 35.1%),
        Taoism (7,600,000 or 33%), Yiguandao (810,000 or 3.5%), Protestantism (605,000
        or 2.6%), and Roman Catholicism (298,000 or 1.3%).</p>\n<p>The CIA World Factbook
        reports that over 93% of Taiwanese are adherents of a combination of the polytheistic
        Chinese popular religion, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism; 4.5% are adherents
        of Christianity, which includes Protestants, Catholics, and other, non-denominational,
        Christian groups; and less than 2.5% are adherents of other religions. Taiwanese
        aborigines comprise a notable subgroup among professing Christians: \"...over
        64% identify as Christian... Church buildings are the most obvious markers
        of Aboriginal villages, distinguishing them from Taiwanese or Hakka villages.\"</p>\n<p>Confucianism
        is a philosophy that deals with secular moral ethics, and serves as the foundation
        of both Chinese and Taiwanese culture. The majority of Taiwanese people usually
        combine the secular moral teachings of Confucianism with whatever religions
        they are affiliated with.</p>\n<p>As of 2009, there were 14,993 temples in
        Taiwan, approximately one place of worship per 1,500 residents. 9,202 of those
        temples were dedicated to Taoism. In 2008, Taiwan had 3,262 Churches, an increase
        of 145.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Largest_cities\">Largest cities</span></h3>\n\n<p>The

        current program was implemented in 1995, and is considered to be a form of
        social insurance. The government health insurance program maintains compulsory
        insurance for citizens who are employed, impoverished, unemployed, or victims
        of natural disasters with fees that correlate to the individual and/or family
        income; it also maintains protection for non-citizens working in Taiwan. A
        standardized method of calculation applies to all persons and can optionally
        be paid by an employer or by individual contributions.</p>\n<p>BNHI insurance
        coverage requires co-payment at the time of service for most services unless
        it is a preventative health service, for low-income families, veterans, children
        under three years old, or in the case of catastrophic diseases. Low income
        households maintain 100% premium coverage by the BNHI and co-pays are reduced
        for disabled or certain elderly people.</p>\n<p>According to a recently published
        survey, out of 3,360\u00a0patients surveyed at a randomly chosen hospital,
        75.1% of the patients said they are \"very satisfied\" with the hospital service;
        20.5% said they are \"okay\" with the service. Only 4.4% of the patients said
        they are either \"not satisfied\" or \"very not satisfied\" with the service

        set up monitored stations throughout public transportation, recreational sites
        and other public areas. With full containment in July 2003, there has not
        been a case of SARS since.</p>\n<p>As of 2006, the BNHI Facility Contract
        Distribution facilities total 17,259, including:</p>\n<p>Basic coverage areas
        of the insurance include:</p>\n<p>In 2004, the infant mortality rate was 5.3
        with 15\u00a0physicians and 63\u00a0hospital beds per 10,000\u00a0people.
        The life expectancy for males was 73.5\u00a0years and 79.7\u00a0years for
        females according to the World Health Report.</p>\n<p>In July 2013, the Department
        of Health was restructured as the Ministry of Health and Welfare.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Culture\">Culture</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The cultures of Taiwan are a hybrid
        blend of various sources, incorporating elements of traditional Chinese culture,
        attributable to the historical and ancestry origin of the majority of its
        current residents, Japanese culture, traditional Confucianist beliefs, and
        increasingly Western values.</p>\n<p>After their move to Taiwan, the Kuomintang
        imposed an official interpretation of traditional Chinese culture over Taiwan.
        The government launched a program promoting Chinese calligraphy, traditional
        Chinese painting, folk art, and Chinese opera.</p>\n<p>The status of Taiwanese
        culture is debated. It is disputed whether Taiwanese culture is a regional
        form of Chinese culture or a distinct culture. Reflecting the continuing controversy
        surrounding the political status of Taiwan, politics continues to play a role
        in the conception and development of a Taiwanese cultural identity, especially
        in the prior dominant frame of a Taiwanese and Chinese dualism. In recent
        years, the concept of Taiwanese multiculturalism has been proposed as a relatively
        apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders
        and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture
        as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought
        and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan. Identity politics, along with
        the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has
        led to distinct traditions in many areas, including cuisine and music.</p>\n\n<p>One
        of Taiwan''s greatest attractions is the National Palace Museum, which houses
        more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting, and
        porcelain and is considered one of the greatest collections of Chinese art
        and objects in the world. The KMT moved this collection from the Forbidden
        City in Beijing in 1933 and part of the collection was eventually transported
        to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. The collection, estimated to be one-tenth
        of China''s cultural treasures, is so extensive that only 1% is on display
        at any time. The PRC had said that the collection was stolen and has called
        for its return, but the ROC has long defended its control of the collection
        as a necessary act to protect the pieces from destruction, especially during
        the Cultural Revolution. Relations regarding this treasure have warmed recently;
        Beijing Palace Museum Curator Zheng Xinmiao said that artefacts in both Chinese
        and Taiwanese museums are \"China''s cultural heritage jointly owned by people
        across the Taiwan Strait.\"</p>\n<p>The classical music culture in Taiwan
        is highly developed and features artists such as violinist Cho-Liang Lin,
        pianist Ching-Yun Hu, and the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society Artist
        Director Wu Han. Karaoke, drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely
        popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like
        style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms varying on the number of guests
        in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to
        form all-encompassing elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or
        businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV''s, equipped
        not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment
        counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the
        city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theatre
        room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a
        place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.</p>\n<p>Taiwan
        has a high density of 24-hour convenience stores, which, in addition to the
        usual services, provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government
        agencies such as collection of parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation
        fines, and credit card payments. They also provide a service for mailing packages.</p>\n<p>Taiwanese
        culture has also influenced other cultures. Bubble tea and milk tea are available
        in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Taiwan television
        shows are popular in Singapore, Malaysia, and other Asian countries. Taiwanese
        films have won various international awards at film festivals around the world.
        Ang Lee, a Taiwanese director, has directed critically acclaimed films such
        as: <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>; <i>Eat Drink Man Woman</i>; <i>Sense
        and Sensibility</i>; <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>; <i>Life of Pi</i>; and <i>Lust,
        Caution</i>. Other famous Taiwanese directors include Tsai Ming-Liang, Edward
        Yang, and Hou Hsiao-hsien.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sports\">Sports</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Baseball
        is Taiwan''s national sport and it is a popular spectator sport. Two of the
        most famous Taiwanese baseball pitchers are Chien-Ming Wang and Wei-Yin Chen;
        both are pitchers in Major League Baseball. Other notable players playing
        in the United States include Chin-hui Tsao who played for the Colorado Rockies
        (2003\u20132005) and the Los Angeles Dodgers (2007, 2015\u20132016), Hong-Chih
        Kuo, Fu-Te Ni, and Chin-lung Hu. The Chinese Professional Baseball League
        in Taiwan was established in 1989, and eventually absorbed the competing Taiwan
        Major League in 2003. As of 2015, the CPBL has four teams with average attendance
        over 5,000 per game.</p>\n<p>Besides baseball, basketball is Taiwan''s major
        sport. Taekwondo has also become a mature and successful sport in recent years.
        In the 2004 Olympics, Chen Shih-hsin and Chu Mu-yen won the first two gold
        medals in women''s flyweight event and men''s flyweight event, respectively.
        Subsequent taekwondo competitors such as Yang Shu-chun have strengthened Taiwan''s
        taekwondo culture.</p>\n<p>Taiwan participates in international sporting organizations
        and events under the name of \"Chinese Taipei\" due to its political status.
        In 2009, Taiwan hosted two international sporting events on the island. The
        World Games 2009 were held in Kaohsiung between 16 and 26 July 2009. Taipei
        hosted the 21st Summer Deaflympics in September of the same year. Furthermore,
        Taipei will host the Summer Universiade in 2017.</p>\n<p>Taiwan is also a
        major Asian country for Korfball. In 2008, Taiwan hosted the World Youth Korfball
        Championship and took the silver medal. In 2009, Taiwan''s korfball team won
        a bronze medal at the World Game.</p>\n<p>Yani Tseng is the most famous Taiwanese
        professional golfer currently playing on the US-based LPGA Tour. She is the
        youngest player ever, male or female, to win five major championships and
        had been ranked number 1 in the Women''s World Golf Rankings for 109 consecutive
        weeks from 2011 to 2013.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Calendar\">Calendar</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taiwan
        uses two official calendars: the Gregorian calendar and the Minguo calendar.
        The latter numbers years starting from 1911, the year of the founding of the
        Republic of China. For example, 2007 was the \"96th year of the Republic\"
        (\u6c11\u570b96\u5e74), while its months and days were numbered according
        to the Gregorian calendar.</p>\n<p>Usually, year numbering may use the Gregorian
        system as well as the ROC era system. For example, 3 May 2004, may be written
        2004-05-03 or 93-05-03. The use of two different calendar systems in Taiwan
        may be confusing, in particular for foreigners. For instance, products for
        export marked using the Minguo calendar can be misunderstood as having an
        expiration date 11\u00a0years earlier than intended.</p>\n<p>Taiwan also uses
        the lunar calendar for traditional festivals such as the Chinese New Year,
        the Lantern Festival, and the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See

        officially the <b>Republic of China</b> (<b>ROC</b>), is a state in East Asia.
        Its neighbors include the People''s Republic of China to the west, Japan to
        the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous
        state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations.</p>\n<p>The
        island of Taiwan, formerly known as Formosa, was inhabited by Taiwanese aborigines
        before the 17th century, when Dutch and Spanish colonies opened the island
        to mass Han immigration. After a brief rule by the Kingdom of Tungning, the
        island was annexed by the Qing dynasty, the last dynasty of China. The Qing
        ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895 after the Sino-Japanese War. While Taiwan was
        under Japanese rule, the Republic of China (ROC) was established on the mainland
        in 1912 after the fall of the Qing dynasty. Following the Japanese surrender
        to the Allies in 1945, the ROC took control of Taiwan. However, the resumption
        of the Chinese Civil War led to the ROC''s loss of the mainland to the Communists,
        and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949. Although the ROC continued
        to claim to be the legitimate government of China, its effective jurisdiction
        has, since the loss of Hainan in 1950, been limited to Taiwan and its surrounding
        islands, with the main island making up 99% of its <i>de facto</i> territory.
        As a founding member of the United Nations, the ROC continued to represent
        China at the United Nations until 1971, when the PRC assumed China''s seat,
        causing the ROC to lose its UN membership.</p>\n<p>In the early 1960s, Taiwan
        entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialization, creating
        a stable industrial economy. In the 1980s and early 1990s, it changed from
        a one-party military dictatorship dominated by the Kuomintang to a multi-party
        democracy with a semi-presidential system. Taiwan is the 22nd-largest economy
        in the world, and its high-tech industry plays a key role in the global economy.
        It is ranked highly in terms of freedom of the press, healthcare, public education,
        economic freedom, and human development. The country benefits from a highly
        skilled workforce and is among the most highly educated countries in the world
        with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education
        degree.</p>\n<p>The PRC has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and
        asserted the ROC is no longer in legitimate existence. Under its One-China
        Policy the PRC refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes
        the ROC. Today 20 countries maintain official ties with the ROC but many other
        states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices and institutions
        that function as <i>de facto</i> embassies and consulates. Although Taiwan
        is fully self-governing, most international organizations in which the PRC
        participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate
        only as a non-state actor. Internally, the major division in politics is between
        the aspirations of eventual Chinese unification or Taiwanese independence,
        though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal.
        The PRC has threatened the use of military force in response to any formal
        declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful
        unification is no longer possible.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n\n<p>There
        are various names for the island of Taiwan in use today, derived from explorers
        or rulers by each particular period. The former name Formosa (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u798f\u723e\u6469\u6c99</span>)
        dates from 1542, when Portuguese sailors sighted the main island of Taiwan
        and named it <i>Ilha Formosa</i>, which means \"beautiful island\". The name
        \"Formosa\" eventually \"replaced all others in European literature\" and
        was in common use in English in the early 20th century.</p>\n<p>In the early
        17th century, the Dutch East India Company established a commercial post at
        Fort Zeelandia (modern-day Anping, Tainan) on a coastal sandbar called \"Tayouan\",
        after their ethnonym for a nearby Taiwanese aboriginal tribe, written by the
        Dutch and Portuguese variously as <i>Taiouwang</i>, <i>Tayowan</i>, <i>Teijoan</i>,
        etc. This name was also adopted into the Chinese vernacular (in particular,
        Hokkien, as Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: <i><span lang=\"nan\">T\u0101i-o\u00e2n/T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n</span></i>)
        as the name of the sandbar and nearby area (Tainan). The modern word \"Taiwan\"
        is derived from this usage, which is seen in various forms (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u5927\u54e1,
        \u5927\u5713, \u5927\u7063, \u81fa\u54e1, \u81fa\u5713</span> and <span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u81fa\u7aa9\u7063</span>)
        in Chinese historical records. The area of modern-day Tainan was the first
        permanent settlement by Western colonists and Chinese immigrants, grew to
        be the most important trading centre, and served as the capital of the island
        until 1887. Use of the current Chinese name (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u81fa\u7063</span>)
        was formalized as early as 1684 with the establishment of Taiwan Prefecture.
        Through its rapid development, the entire Formosan mainland eventually became
        known as \"Taiwan\".</p>\n<p>In his <i>Daoyi Zhil\u00fce</i> (1349), Wang
        Dayuan used \"Liuqiu\" as a name for the island of Taiwan, or the part of
        it near to Penghu. Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in
        general or Okinawa, the largest of them; indeed the name <i>Ry\u016bky\u016b</i>
        is the Japanese form of <i>Li\u00faqi\u00fa</i>. The name also appears in
        the <i>Book of Sui</i> (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree
        on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even Luzon.</p>\n<p>The
        official name of the state is the \"Republic of China\"; it has also been
        known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC''s
        establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland,
        the government used the short form \"China\" <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3</span></i>
        <span>(<span lang=\"zh\">\u4e2d\u570b</span>),</span> to refer to itself,
        which derives from <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">zh\u014dng</span></i>
        (\"central\" or \"middle\") and <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">gu\u00f3</span></i>
        (\"state, nation-state\"),  A term which also developed under the Zhou Dynasty
        in reference to its royal demesne and the name was then applied to the area
        around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China''s
        Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under
        the Qingera . During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had fled to
        Taiwan due to losing the Chinese Civil War, it was commonly referred to as
        \"<b>Nationalist China</b>\" (or \"Free China\") to differentiate it from
        \"Communist China\" (or \"Red China\"). It was a member of the United Nations
        representing \"<i>China</i>\" until 1971, when it lost its seat to the People''s
        Republic of China. Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become
        commonly known as \"Taiwan\", after the island that comprises 99% of the territory
        under its control. In some contexts, especially official ones from the ROC
        government, the name is written as \"Republic of China (Taiwan)\", \"Republic
        of China/Taiwan\", or sometimes \"Taiwan (ROC).\" The Republic of China participates
        in most international forums and organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei\"
        due to diplomatic pressure from the People''s Republic of China. For instance,
        it is the name under which it has competed at the Olympic Games since 1984,
        and its name as an observer at the World Health Organization.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Prehistoric_Taiwan\">Prehistoric
        Taiwan</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Taiwan was joined to the mainland in the Late Pleistocene,
        until sea levels rose about 10,000 years ago. Fragmentary human remains dated
        20,000 to 30,000 years ago have been found on the island, as well as later
        artefacts of a Paleolithic culture.</p>\n<p>Around 6,000 years ago, Taiwan
        was settled by farmers, most likely from mainland China. They are believed
        to be the ancestors of today''s Taiwanese aborigines, whose languages belong
        to the Austronesian language family, but show much greater diversity than
        the rest of the family, which spans a huge area from Maritime Southeast Asia
        west to Madagascar and east as far as New Zealand, Hawaii and Easter Island.
        This has led linguists to propose Taiwan as the urheimat of the family, from
        which seafaring peoples dispersed across Southeast Asia and the Pacific and
        Indian Oceans.</p>\n<p>Han Chinese fishermen began settling in the Penghu
        islands in the 13th century. Hostile tribes, and a lack of valuable trade
        products, meant that few outsiders visited the main island until the 16th
        century. By the 1700''s visits to the coast by fishermen from Fujian, as well
        as Chinese and Japanese pirates, became more frequent.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Opening_in_the_17th_century\">Opening
        in the 17th century</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The Dutch East India Company attempted
        to establish a trading outpost on the Penghu Islands (Pescadores) in 1622,
        but were militarily defeated and driven off by the Ming authorities.</p>\n<p>In
        1624, the company established a stronghold called Fort Zeelandia on the coastal
        islet of Tayouan, which is now part of the main island at Anping, Tainan.
        David Wright, a Scottish agent of the company who lived on the island in the
        1650s, described the lowland areas of the island as being divided among 11
        chiefdoms ranging in size from two settlements to 72. Some of these fell under
        Dutch control, while others remained independent. The Company began to import
        labourers from Fujian and Penghu (Pescadores), many of whom settled.</p>\n<p>In
        1626, the Spanish Empire landed on and occupied northern Taiwan, at the ports
        of Keelung and Tamsui, as a base to extend their trading. This colonial period
        lasted 16 years until 1642, when the last Spanish fortress fell to Dutch forces.</p>\n<p>Following
        the fall of the Ming dynasty, Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), a self-styled Ming
        loyalist, arrived on the island and captured Fort Zeelandia in 1662, expelling
        the Dutch Empire and military from the island. Koxinga established the Kingdom
        of Tungning (1662\u20131683), with his capital at Tainan. He and his heirs,
        Zheng Jing, who ruled from 1662 to 1682, and Zheng Keshuang, who ruled less
        than a year, continued to launch raids on the southeast coast of mainland
        China well into the Qing dynasty era.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Qing_rule\">Qing
        rule</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>In 1683, following the defeat of Koxinga''s grandson
        by an armada led by Admiral Shi Lang of southern Fujian, the Qing dynasty
        formally annexed Taiwan, placing it under the jurisdiction of Fujian province.
        The Qing imperial government tried to reduce piracy and vagrancy in the area,
        issuing a series of edicts to manage immigration and respect aboriginal land
        rights. Immigrants mostly from southern Fujian continued to enter Taiwan.
        The border between taxpaying lands and \"savage\" lands shifted eastward,
        with some aborigines becoming sinicized while others retreated into the mountains.
        During this time, there were a number of conflicts between groups of Han Chinese
        from different regions of southern Fujian, particularly between those from
        Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, and between southern Fujian Chinese and aborigines.</p>\n<p>Northern
        Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were the scene of subsidiary campaigns in the
        Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885). The French occupied Keelung on
        1 October 1884, but were repulsed from Tamsui a few days later. The French
        won some tactical victories but were unable to exploit them, and the Keelung
        Campaign ended in stalemate. The Pescadores Campaign, beginning on 31 March
        1885, was a French victory, but had no long-term consequences. The French
        evacuated both Keelung and the Penghu archipelago after the end of the war.</p>\n<p>In
        1887, the Qing upgraded the island''s administration from Taiwan Prefecture
        of Fujian to Fujian-Taiwan-Province (\u798f\u5efa\u81fa\u7063\u7701), the
        twentieth in the empire, with its capital at Taipei. This was accompanied
        by a modernization drive that included building China''s first railroad.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Japanese_rule\">Japanese rule</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>As the Qing dynasty
        was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895), Taiwan, along
        with Penghu and Liaodong Peninsula, were ceded in full sovereignty to the
        Empire of Japan by the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Inhabitants on Taiwan and Penghu
        wishing to remain Qing subjects were given a two-year grace period to sell
        their property and move to mainland China. Very few Taiwanese saw this as
        feasible. On 25 May 1895, a group of pro-Qing high officials proclaimed the
        Republic of Formosa to resist impending Japanese rule. Japanese forces entered
        the capital at Tainan and quelled this resistance on 21 October 1895. Guerrilla
        fighting continued periodically until about 1902 and ultimately took the lives
        of 14,000 Taiwanese, or 0.5% of the population. Several subsequent rebellions
        against the Japanese (the Beipu uprising of 1907, the Tapani incident of 1915,
        and the Musha incident of 1930) were all unsuccessful but demonstrated opposition
        to Japanese colonial rule.</p>\n<p>Japanese colonial rule was instrumental
        in the industrialization of the island, extending the railroads and other
        transportation networks, building an extensive sanitation system, and establishing
        a formal education system. Japanese rule ended the practice of headhunting.
        During this period the human and natural resources of Taiwan were used to
        aid the development of Japan and the production of cash crops such as rice
        and sugar greatly increased. By 1939, Taiwan was the seventh greatest sugar
        producer in the world. Still, the Taiwanese and aborigines were classified
        as second- and third-class citizens. After suppressing Chinese guerrillas
        in the first decade of their rule, Japanese authorities engaged in a series
        of bloody campaigns against the mountain aboriginals, culminating in the Musha
        Incident of 1930. Intellectuals and laborers who participated in left-wing
        movements within Taiwan were also arrested and massacred (e.g. Tsi\u00fann
        U\u012b-Su\u00ed(\u8523\u6e2d\u6c34), Masanosuke Watanabe (\u6e21\u8fba\u653f\u4e4b\u8f85)).</p>\n<p>Around
        1935, the Japanese began an island-wide assimilation project to bind the island
        more firmly to the Japanese Empire and people were taught to see themselves
        as Japanese under the Kominka Movement, during which time Taiwanese culture
        and religion were outlawed and the citizens were encouraged to adopt Japanese
        surnames. The \"South Strike Group\" was based at the Taihoku Imperial University
        in Taipei. During World War II, tens of thousands of Taiwanese served in the
        Japanese military. For example, former ROC President Lee Teng-hui''s elder
        brother served in the Japanese navy and was killed in action in the Philippines
        in February 1945. The Imperial Japanese Navy operated heavily out of Taiwanese
        ports. In October 1944, the Formosa Air Battle was fought between American
        carriers and Japanese forces based in Taiwan. Important Japanese military
        bases and industrial centres throughout Taiwan, like Kaohsiung, were targets
        of heavy American bombings. Also during this time, over 2,000 women were forced
        into sexual slavery for Imperial Japanese troops, now euphemistically called
        \"comfort women.\"</p>\n<p>In 1938, there were 309,000 Japanese settlers in
        Taiwan. After World War II, most of the Japanese were expelled and sent to
        Japan.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Republic_of_China\">Republic of China</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During
        Japanese rule of Taiwan, on 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was declared
        with Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (the KMT or Nationalist Party) was proclaimed
        provisional president following the Xinhai Revolution, which itself began
        with the Wuchang Uprising on 10 October 1911, overthrowing the Qing Dynasty
        and ending over two thousand years of imperial rule in China. However, the
        presidency was later given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general who in 1915
        proclaimed himself Emperor of China. In the face of popular condemnation and
        opposition from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to abdicate and re-establish
        the republic.</p>\n<p>Since its founding until 1949 it was based on mainland
        China. Central authority waxed and waned in response to warlordism (1915\u201328)
        after Yuan Shikai''s death in 1916,, Japanese invasion (1937\u201345), and
        the Chinese Civil War (1927\u201349), with central authority strongest during
        the Nanjing Decade (1927\u201337), when most of China came under the control
        of the Kuomintang (KMT) under an authoritarian one-party state.</p>\n<p>After
        the Surrender of Japan, on 25 October 1945, the US Navy ferried ROC troops
        to Taiwan in order to accept the formal surrender of Japanese military forces
        in Taipei on behalf of the Allied Powers, as part of General Order No. 1 for
        temporary military occupation. General Rikichi And\u014d, governor-general
        of Taiwan and commander-in-chief of all Japanese forces on the island, signed
        the receipt and handed it over to General Chen Yi of the ROC military to complete
        the official turnover. Chen Yi proclaimed that day to be \"Taiwan Retrocession
        Day\", but the Allies considered Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to be under
        military occupation and still under Japanese sovereignty until 1952, when
        the Treaty of San Francisco took effect. Although the 1943 Cairo Declaration
        had envisaged returning these territories to China, in the Treaty of San Francisco
        and Treaty of Taipei Japan has renounced all claim to them without specifying
        to what country they were to be surrendered. This introduced the problem of
        the legal status of Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The ROC administration of Taiwan under
        Chen Yi was strained by increasing tensions between Taiwanese-born people
        and newly arrived mainlanders, which were compounded by economic woes, such
        as hyperinflation. Furthermore, cultural and linguistic conflicts between
        the two groups quickly led to the loss of popular support for the new government,
        while the mass movement led by the working committee of the Communist Party
        also aimed to bring down the Kuomintang government. The shooting of a civilian
        on 28 February 1947 triggered island-wide unrest, which was suppressed with
        military force in what is now called the February 28 Incident. Mainstream
        estimates of the number killed range from 18,000 to 30,000. Those killed were
        mainly members of the Taiwanese elite.</p>\n\n<p>After the end of World War
        II, the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Chinese Nationalists (Kuomintang),
        led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong.
        Throughout the months of 1949, a series of Chinese Communist offensives led
        to the capture of its capital Nanjing on 23 April and the subsequent defeat
        of the Nationalist army on the mainland, and the Communists founded the People''s
        Republic of China on 1 October.</p>\n<p>On 7 December 1949, after the loss
        of four capitals, Chiang evacuated his Nationalist government to Taiwan and
        made Taipei the temporary capital of the ROC (also called the \"wartime capital\"
        by Chiang Kai-shek). Some 2 million people, consisting mainly of soldiers,
        members of the ruling Kuomintang and intellectual and business elites, were
        evacuated from mainland China to Taiwan at that time, adding to the earlier
        population of approximately six million. In addition, the ROC government took
        to Taipei many national treasures and much of China''s gold reserves and foreign
        currency reserves.</p>\n<p>After losing most of the mainland, the Kuomintang
        held remaining control of Tibet, the portions of Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Yunnan
        provinces along with the Hainan Island until 1951 before the Communists subsequently
        captured both territories. From this point onwards, the Kuomintang''s territory
        was reduced to Taiwan, Penghu, the portions of the Fujian province (Kinmen
        and Matsu Islands), and two major islands of Dongsha Islands and Nansha Islands.
        The Kuomintang continued to claim sovereignty over all \"China\", which it
        defined to include mainland China, Taiwan, Outer Mongolia and other areas.
        On mainland China, the victorious Communists claimed they ruled the sole and
        only China (which they claimed included Taiwan) and that the Republic of China
        no longer existed.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"Chinese_Nationalist_one-party_rule\">Chinese
        Nationalist one-party rule</span></h4>\n<p>Martial law, declared on Taiwan
        in May 1949, continued to be in effect after the central government relocated
        to Taiwan. It was not repealed until 1987, and was used as a way to suppress
        the political opposition in the intervening years. During the White Terror,
        as the period is known, 140,000 people were imprisoned or executed for being
        perceived as anti-KMT or pro-Communist. Many citizens were arrested, tortured,
        imprisoned and executed for their real or perceived link to the Communists.
        Since these people were mainly from the intellectual and social elite, an
        entire generation of political and social leaders was decimated. In 1998 law
        was passed to create the \"Compensation Foundation for Improper Verdicts\"
        which oversaw compensation to White Terror victims and families. President
        Ma Ying-jeou made an official apology in 2008, expressing hope that there
        will never be a tragedy similar to White Terror.</p>\n<p>Initially, the United
        States abandoned the KMT and expected that Taiwan would fall to the Communists.
        However, in 1950 the conflict between North Korea and South Korea, which had
        been ongoing since the Japanese withdrawal in 1945, escalated into full-blown
        war, and in the context of the Cold War, US President Harry S. Truman intervened
        again and dispatched the US Navy''s 7th Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent
        hostilities between Taiwan and mainland China. In the Treaty of San Francisco
        and the Treaty of Taipei, which came into force respectively on 28 April 1952
        and 5 August 1952, Japan formally renounced all right, claim and title to
        Taiwan and Penghu, and renounced all treaties signed with China before 1942.
        Neither treaty specified to whom sovereignty over the islands should be transferred,
        because the United States and the United Kingdom disagreed on whether the
        ROC or the PRC was the legitimate government of China. Continuing conflict
        of the Chinese Civil War through the 1950s, and intervention by the United
        States notably resulted in legislation such as the Sino-American Mutual Defense
        Treaty and the Formosa Resolution of 1955.</p>\n\n<p>As the Chinese Civil
        War continued without truce, the government built up military fortifications
        throughout Taiwan. Within this effort, KMT veterans built the now famous Central
        Cross-Island Highway through the Taroko Gorge in the 1950s. The two sides
        would continue to engage in sporadic military clashes with seldom publicized
        details well into the 1960s on the China coastal islands with an unknown number
        of night raids. During the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in September 1958,
        Taiwan''s landscape saw Nike-Hercules missile batteries added, with the formation
        of the 1st Missile Battalion Chinese Army that would not be deactivated until
        1997. Newer generations of missile batteries have since replaced the Nike
        Hercules systems throughout the island.</p>\n<p>During the 1960s and 1970s,
        the ROC maintained an authoritarian, single-party government while its economy
        became industrialized and technology oriented. This rapid economic growth,
        known as the Taiwan Miracle, was the result of a fiscal regime independent
        from mainland China and backed up, among others, by the support of US funds
        and demand for Taiwanese products. In the 1970s, Taiwan was economically the
        second fastest growing state in Asia after Japan. Taiwan, along with Hong
        Kong, South Korea and Singapore, became known as one of the Four Asian Tigers.
        Because of the Cold War, most Western nations and the United Nations regarded
        the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China until the 1970s. Later,
        especially after the termination of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty,
        most nations switched diplomatic recognition to the PRC (see United Nations
        General Assembly Resolution 2758).</p>\n<p>Up until the 1970s, the government
        was regarded by Western critics as undemocratic for upholding martial law,
        for severely repressing any political opposition and for controlling media.
        The KMT did not allow the creation of new parties and those that existed did
        not seriously compete with the KMT. Thus, competitive democratic elections
        did not exist. From the late 1970s to the 1990s, however, Taiwan went through
        reforms and social changes that transformed it from an authoritarian state
        to a democracy. In 1979, a pro-democracy protest known as the Kaohsiung Incident
        took place in Kaohsiung to celebrate Human Rights Day. Although the protest
        was rapidly crushed by the authorities, it is today considered as the main
        event that united Taiwan''s opposition.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Democratization\">Democratization</span></h4>\n\n<p>Chiang
        Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek''s son and successor as the president, began to
        liberalize the political system in the mid-1980s. In 1984, the younger Chiang
        selected Lee Teng-hui, a Taiwanese-born, US-educated technocrat, to be his
        vice-president. In 1986, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was formed
        and inaugurated as the first opposition party in the ROC to counter the KMT.
        A year later, Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law on the main island of Taiwan
        (martial law was lifted on Penghu in 1979, Matsu island in 1992 and Kinmen
        island in 1993). With the advent of democratization, the issue of the political
        status of Taiwan gradually resurfaced as a controversial issue where, previously,
        the discussion of anything other than unification under the ROC was taboo.</p>\n<p>After
        the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, Lee Teng-hui succeeded him
        as president. Lee continued to democratize the government and decrease the
        concentration of government authority in the hands of mainland Chinese. Under
        Lee, Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which Taiwanese culture
        and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint in contrast to earlier
        KMT policies which had promoted a Chinese identity. Lee''s reforms included
        printing banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of
        Taiwan, and streamlining the Taiwan Provincial Government with most of its
        functions transferred to the Executive Yuan. Under Lee, the original members
        of the Legislative Yuan and National Assembly(a former supreme legislative
        body defunct in 2005\uff09, elected in 1947 to represent mainland Chinese
        constituencies and having held the seats without re-election for more than
        four decades, were forced to resign in 1991. The previously nominal representation
        in the Legislative Yuan was brought to an end, reflecting the reality that
        the ROC had no jurisdiction over mainland China, and vice versa. Restrictions
        on the use of Taiwanese Hokkien in the broadcast media and in schools were
        also lifted.</p>\n\n<p>Democratic reforms continued in the 1990s, with Lee
        Teng-hui re-elected in 1996, in the first direct presidential election in
        the history of the ROC. During the later years of Lee''s administration, he
        was involved in corruption controversies relating to government release of
        land and weapons purchase, although no legal proceedings commenced. In 1997,\"To
        meet the requisites of the nation prior to national unification\", the Additional
        Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China was passed and then
        the former \"constitution of five powers\" turns to be more tripartite. In
        2000, Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party was elected as the
        first non-Kuomintang (KMT) President and was re-elected to serve his second
        and last term since 2004. Polarized politics has emerged in Taiwan with the
        formation of the Pan-Blue Coalition of parties led by the KMT, favouring eventual
        Chinese reunification, and the Pan-Green Coalition of parties led by the DPP,
        favouring an eventual and official declaration of Taiwanese independence.
        In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian remarked: \u201cThe National Unification
        Council will cease to function. No budget will be ear-marked for it and its
        personnel must return to their original posts...The National Unification Guidelines
        will cease to apply.\"</p>\n\n<p>On 30 September 2007, the ruling DPP approved
        a resolution asserting a separate identity from China and called for the enactment
        of a new constitution for a \"normal country\". It also called for general
        use of \"Taiwan\" as the country''s name, without abolishing its formal name,
        the Republic of China. The Chen administration also pushed for referendums
        on national defence and UN entry in the 2004 and 2008 elections, which failed
        due to voter turnout below the required legal threshold of 50% of all registered
        voters. The Chen administration was dogged by public concerns over reduced
        economic growth, legislative gridlock due to a pan-blue, opposition-controlled
        Legislative Yuan and corruption involving the First Family as well as government
        officials.</p>\n<p>The KMT increased its majority in the Legislative Yuan
        in the January 2008 legislative elections, while its nominee Ma Ying-jeou
        went on to win the presidency in March of the same year, campaigning on a
        platform of increased economic growth and better ties with the PRC under a
        policy of \"mutual nondenial\". Ma took office on 20 May 2008, the same day
        that President Chen Shui-bian stepped down and was notified by prosecutors
        of possible corruption charges. Part of the rationale for campaigning for
        closer economic ties with the PRC stems from the strong economic growth China
        attained since joining the World Trade Organization. However, some analysts
        say that despite the election of Ma Ying-jeou, the diplomatic and military
        tensions with the PRC have not been reduced.</p>\n<p>On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional
        Court ruled that current marriage laws are unconstitutional and that same-sex
        couples in the Taiwanese LGBT community should have the right to marry. The
        court has given the Legislative Yuan two years to adequately amend Taiwanese
        marriage laws. According to the court ruling, if amendments are not passed
        within two years, same-sex marriages will automatically become legal in Taiwan.</p>\n<h2><span

        jurisdiction of the Republic of China is 36,193\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (13,974\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),
        making it the world''s 137th-largest country/dependency, smaller than Switzerland
        and larger than Belgium.</p>\n<p>The island of Taiwan has an area of 35,883\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>
        (13,855\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and lies some 180 kilometres (110\u00a0mi) from
        the southeastern coast of mainland China across the Taiwan Strait. The East
        China Sea lies to the north, the Philippine Sea to the east, the Bashi Channel
        of the Luzon Strait directly to the south, and the South China Sea to the
        southwest. Its shape is similar to a sweet potato, giving rise to the name
        <i>sweet potato</i> used by Taiwanese Hokkien speakers for people of Taiwanese
        descent.</p>\n<p>The island is characterized by the contrast between the eastern
        two-thirds, consisting mostly of rugged mountains running in five ranges from
        the northern to the southern tip of the island, and the flat to gently rolling
        Chianan Plains in the west that are also home to most of Taiwan''s population.
        Taiwan''s highest point is Yu Shan (Jade Mountain) at 3,952 metres (12,966\u00a0ft),
        making Taiwan the world''s fourth-highest island.</p>\n<p>The Penghu Islands,
        50\u00a0km (31.1\u00a0mi) west of the main island, have an area of 126.9\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>
        (49.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). More distant islands controlled by the Republic of
        China are the Kinmen, Wuchiu and Matsu Islands off the coast of Fujian, with
        a total area of 180.5\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (69.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and the

        of 2.9\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (1.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and no permanent inhabitants.
        The ROC government also claims the Senkaku Islands to the northeast, which
        are controlled by Japan.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Climate\">Climate</span></h3>\n<p>Taiwan
        lies on the Tropic of Cancer, and its general climate is marine tropical.
        The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical
        and the mountainous regions are temperate. The average rainfall is 2,600 millimetres
        (100 inches) per year for the island proper; the rainy season is concurrent
        with the onset of the summer East Asian Monsoon in May and June. The entire
        island experiences hot, humid weather from June through September. Typhoons
        are most common in July, August and September. During the winter (November
        to March), the northeast experiences steady rain, while the central and southern
        parts of the island are mostly sunny.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Geology\">Geology</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        island of Taiwan lies in a complex tectonic area between the Yangtze Plate
        to the west and north, the Okinawa Plate on the north-east, and the Philippine
        Mobile Belt on the east and south. The upper part of the crust on the island
        is primarily made up of a series of terranes, mostly old island arcs which
        have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the Eurasian
        Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. These have been further uplifted as a
        result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was subducted
        beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust
        under Taiwan more buoyant.</p>\n<p>The east and south of Taiwan are a complex
        system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between
        the North Luzon Trough portion of the Luzon Volcanic Arc and South China,
        where accreted portions of the Luzon Arc and Luzon forearc form the eastern
        Coastal Range and parallel inland Longitudinal Valley of Taiwan respectively.</p>\n<p>The
        major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between
        the various terranes. These have produced major quakes throughout the history
        of the island. On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the \"921 earthquake\"
        killed more than 2,400 people. The seismic hazard map for Taiwan by the USGS
        shows 9/10 of the island as the highest rating (most hazardous).</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Political_and_legal_status\">Political and legal status</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The
        political and legal statuses of Taiwan are contentious issues. The People''s
        Republic of China (PRC) claims that the Republic of China government is illegitimate,
        referring to it as the \"Taiwan Authority\" even though current ROC territories
        have never been controlled by the PRC. The ROC has its own constitution, independently
        elected president and armed forces. It has not formally renounced its claim
        to the mainland, but ROC government publications have increasingly downplayed
        it.</p>\n<p>Internationally, there is controversy on whether the ROC still
        exists as a state or a defunct state per international law due to the lack
        of wide diplomatic recognition. In a poll of Taiwanese aged 20 and older taken
        by TVBS in March 2009, a majority of 64% opted for the \"status quo\", while
        19% favoured \"independence\" and 5% favoured \"unification\".</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Relations_with_the_PRC\">Relations with the PRC</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        political environment is complicated by the potential for military conflict
        should Taiwan declare de jure independence; it is the official PRC policy
        to use force to ensure unification if peaceful unification is no longer possible,
        as stated in its anti-secession law, and for this reason there are substantial
        military installations on the Fujian coast.</p>\n<p>On 29 April 2005, Kuomintang
        Chairman Lien Chan travelled to Beijing and met with Communist Party of China
        (CPC) Secretary-General Hu Jintao, the first meeting between the leaders of
        the two parties since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. On 11 February
        2014, Mainland Affairs Council Head Wang Yu-chi travelled to Nanjing and met
        with Taiwan Affairs Office Head Zhang Zhijun, the first meeting between high-ranking
        officials from either side. Zhang paid a reciprocal visit to Taiwan and met
        Wang on 25 June 2014, making Zhang the first minister-level PRC official to
        ever visit Taiwan. On 7 November 2015, Ma Ying-jeou (in his capacity as <i>Leader
        of Taiwan</i>) and Xi Jinping (in his capacity as <i>Leader of Mainland China</i>)
        travelled to Singapore and met up, marking the highest-level exchange between
        the two sides since 1949.</p>\n<p>The PRC supports a version of the One-China
        policy, which states that Taiwan and mainland China are both part of China,
        and that the PRC is the only legitimate government of China. It uses this
        policy to prevent the international recognition of the ROC as an independent
        sovereign state, meaning that Taiwan participates in international forums
        under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". With the emergence of the Taiwanese independence
        movement, the name \"Taiwan\" has been employed increasingly often on the
        island.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Foreign_relations\">Foreign relations</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before
        1928, the foreign policy of Republican China was complicated by a lack of
        internal unity\u2014competing centres of power all claimed legitimacy. This
        situation changed after the defeat of the Peiyang Government by the Kuomintang,
        which led to widespread diplomatic recognition of the Republic of China.</p>\n<p>After
        the KMT''s retreat to Taiwan, most countries, notably the countries in the
        Western Bloc, continued to maintain relations with the ROC. Due to diplomatic
        pressure, recognition gradually eroded and many countries switched recognition
        to the PRC in the 1970s. UN Resolution 2758 (25 October 1971) recognized the
        People''s Republic of China as China''s sole representative in the United
        Nations.</p>\n<p>The PRC refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation
        that recognizes the ROC, and requires all nations with which it has diplomatic
        relations to make a statement recognizing its claims to Taiwan. As a result,
        only 19\u00a0UN member states and the Holy See maintain official diplomatic
        relations with the Republic of China. The ROC maintains unofficial relations
        with most countries via <i>de facto</i> embassies and consulates called Taipei
        Economic and Cultural Representative Offices (TECRO), with branch offices
        called \"Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices\" (TECO). Both TECRO and TECO
        are \"unofficial commercial entities\" of the ROC in charge of maintaining
        diplomatic relations, providing consular services (i.e. visa applications),
        and serving the national interests of the ROC in other countries.</p>\n<p>The
        United States remains one of the main allies of the country and, through the
        Taiwan Relations Act passed in 1979, has continued selling arms and providing
        military training to the Armed Forces. This situation continues to be an issue
        for the People''s Republic of China which considers US involvement disruptive
        to the stability of the region. In January 2010, the Obama administration
        announced its intention to sell $6.4 billion worth of military hardware to
        Taiwan. As a consequence, the PRC threatened the US with economic sanctions
        and warned that their co-operation on international and regional issues could
        suffer.</p>\n<p>The official position of the United States is that the PRC
        is expected to \"use no force or threat[en] to use force against Taiwan\"
        and the ROC is to \"exercise prudence in managing all aspects of Cross-Strait
        relations.\" Both are to refrain from performing actions or espousing statements
        \"that would unilaterally alter Taiwan''s status.\"</p>\n<p>On 16 December
        2015, the Obama administration announced a deal to sell $1.83 billion worth
        of arms to the armed forces of the ROC. China''s foreign ministry had expressed
        its disapproval for the sales and issued the US a \"stern warning\", saying
        it would hurt China\u2013US relations.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Participation_in_international_events_and_organizations\">Participation
        in international events and organizations</span></h3>\n\n<p>The ROC was a
        founding member of the United Nations, and held the seat of China on the Security
        Council and other UN bodies until 1971, when it was expelled by Resolution
        2758 and replaced in all UN organs with the PRC. Each year since 1992, the
        ROC has petitioned the UN for entry, but its applications have not made it
        past committee.</p>\n\n<p>Due to its limited international recognition, the
        Republic of China is a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization,
        represented by a government-funded organization, the Taiwan Foundation for
        Democracy (TFD) under the name \"Taiwan\".</p>\n<p>Also due to its One China
        policy, the PRC only participates in international organizations where the
        ROC is not recognized as a sovereign country. Most member states, including
        the United States, do not wish to discuss the issue of the ROC''s political
        status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the PRC. However, both the
        US and Japan publicly support the ROC''s bid for membership in the World Health
        Organization as an observer. However, though the ROC sought to participate
        in the WHO since 1997, their efforts were blocked by the PRC until 2010, when
        they were invited as observers to attend the World Health Assembly, under
        the name \"Chinese Taipei\".</p>\n<p>Due to PRC pressure, the ROC is forced
        to use the name \"Chinese Taipei\" in international events, such as the Olympic
        Games, where the PRC is also a party. The ROC is typically barred from using
        its national anthem and national flag in international events due to PRC pressure;
        ROC spectators attending events such as the Olympics are often barred from
        bringing ROC flags into venues. Taiwan also participates in the Asia-Pacific
        Economic Cooperation forum (since 1991) and the World Trade Organization (since
        2002) under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". The ROC is able to participate as
        \"China\" in organizations that the PRC does not participate in, such as the
        World Organization of the Scout Movement.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Opinions_within_Taiwan\">Opinions
        within Taiwan</span></h3>\n\n<p>Within Taiwan, opinions are polarized between
        those supporting unification, represented by the Pan-Blue Coalition of parties,
        and those supporting independence, represented by the Pan-Green Coalition.</p>\n<p>The
        KMT, the largest Pan-Blue party, supports the status quo for the indefinite
        future with a stated ultimate goal of unification. However, it does not support
        unification in the short term with the PRC as such a prospect would be unacceptable
        to most of its members and the public. Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the KMT and
        former president of the ROC, has set out democracy, economic development to
        a level near that of Taiwan, and equitable wealth distribution as the conditions
        that the PRC must fulfill for reunification to occur.</p>\n<p>The Democratic
        Progressive Party, the largest Pan-Green party, officially seeks independence,
        but in practice also supports the status quo because its members and the public
        would not accept the risk of provoking the PRC.</p>\n<p>On 2 September 2008,
        Mexican newspaper <i>El Sol de M\u00e9xico</i> asked President Ma about his
        views on the subject of \"two Chinas\" and if there was a solution for the
        sovereignty issues between the two. The president replied that the relations
        are neither between two Chinas nor two states. It is a special relationship.
        Further, he stated that the sovereignty issues between the two cannot be resolved
        at present, but he quoted the \"1992 Consensus\", currently accepted by both
        the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China, as a temporary measure until
        a solution becomes available.</p>\n<p>On 27 September 2017, Taiwanese premier
        William Lai said that he was a \u201cpolitical worker who advocates Taiwan
        independence\u201d, but that as Taiwan was an independent country called the
        Republic of China, it had no need to declare independence. The relationship
        with the PRC and the related issues of Taiwanese independence and Chinese
        unification continue to dominate politics.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Government_and_politics\">Government
        and politics</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The government of the Republic of China
        was founded on the Constitution of the ROC and its Three Principles of the
        People, which states that the ROC \"shall be a democratic republic of the
        people, to be governed by the people and for the people.\" The government
        is divided into five branches (<i>Yuan</i>): the Executive Yuan (cabinet),
        the Legislative Yuan (Congress or Parliament), the Judicial Yuan, the Control
        Yuan (audit agency), and the Examination Yuan (civil service examination agency).
        The constitution was drafted before the fall of mainland China to the Communist
        Party of China. It was created by the KMT for the purpose of all of its claimed
        territory, including Taiwan, even though the Communist Party boycotted the
        drafting of the constitution. The constitution went into effect on 25 December
        1947. The ROC remained under martial law from 1948 until 1987 and much of
        the constitution was not in effect. Political reforms beginning in the late
        1970s and continuing through the early 1990s liberalized the country and transformed
        into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic
        of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components
        that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment
        continues. In 2000, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidency,
        ending KMT''s continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National
        Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement
        several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National
        Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of
        constitutional reform to the popular ballot.</p>\n<p>The head of state and
        commander-in-chief of the armed forces is the president, who is elected by
        popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the
        vice-president. The president has authority over the Yuan. The president appoints
        the members of the Executive Yuan as his cabinet, including a premier, who
        is officially the President of the Executive Yuan; members are responsible
        for policy and administration.</p>\n<p>The main legislative body is the unicameral
        Legislative Yuan with 113 seats. Seventy-three are elected by popular vote
        from single-member constituencies; thirty-four are elected based on the proportion
        of nationwide votes received by participating political parties in a separate
        party list ballot; and six are elected from two three-member aboriginal constituencies.
        Members serve four-year terms. Originally the unicameral National Assembly,
        as a standing constitutional convention and electoral college, held some parliamentary
        functions, but the National Assembly was abolished in 2005 with the power
        of constitutional amendments handed over to the Legislative Yuan and all eligible
        voters of the Republic via referendums.</p>\n<p>The premier is selected by
        the president without the need for approval from the legislature, but the
        legislature can pass laws without regard for the president, as neither he
        nor the Premier wields veto power. Thus, there is little incentive for the
        president and the legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing
        parties. After the election of the pan-Green''s Chen Shui-bian as President
        in 2000, legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the Legislative
        Yuan, which was controlled by a pan-Blue majority. Historically, the ROC has
        been dominated by strongman single party politics. This legacy has resulted
        in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the president
        rather than the premier, even though the constitution does not explicitly
        state the extent of the president''s executive power.</p>\n<p>The Judicial
        Yuan is the highest judicial organ. It interprets the constitution and other
        laws and decrees, judges administrative suits, and disciplines public functionaries.
        The president and vice-president of the Judicial Yuan and additional thirteen
        justices form the Council of Grand Justices. They are nominated and appointed
        by the president, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The highest court,
        the Supreme Court, consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each
        of which is formed by a presiding judge and four associate judges, all appointed
        for life. In 1993, a separate constitutional court was established to resolve
        constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and
        accelerate the democratization process. There is no trial by jury but the
        right to a fair public trial is protected by law and respected in practice;
        many cases are presided over by multiple judges.</p>\n\n<p>Capital punishment
        is still used in Taiwan, although efforts have been made by the government
        to reduce the number of executions. Nevertheless, according to a survey in
        2006, about 80% of Taiwanese still wanted to keep the death penalty.</p>\n<p>The
        Control Yuan is a watchdog agency that monitors (controls) the actions of
        the executive. It can be considered a standing commission for administrative
        inquiry and can be compared to the Court of Auditors of the European Union
        or the Government Accountability Office of the United States.</p>\n<p>The
        Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants.
        It is based on the old imperial examination system used in dynastic China.
        It can be compared to the European Personnel Selection Office of the European
        Union or the Office of Personnel Management of the United States.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Major_camps\">Major camps</span></h3>\n\n<p>The tension between China
        and Taiwan colours most of the political life, and any government move towards
        \"Taiwan independence\" is met by threat of military attack from the PRC.
        The PRC''s official policy is to reunify Taiwan and mainland China under the
        formula of \"one country, two systems\" and refuses to renounce the use of
        military force, especially should Taiwan seek a declaration of independence.</p>\n<p>The
        political scene is generally divided into two major camps in terms of views
        on how Taiwan should relate to China or the PRC, referred to as cross-Strait
        relations. It is the main political difference between two camps: the Pan-Blue
        Coalition, composed of the pro-unification Kuomintang, People First Party
        (PFP), and New Party, who believe that the ROC is the sole legitimate government
        of \"China\" (including Taiwan) and supports eventual Chinese reunification.
        The opposition Pan-Green Coalition is composed of the pro-independence DPP
        and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU). It regards Taiwan as an independent, sovereign
        state synonymous with the ROC, opposes the definition that Taiwan is part
        of \"China\", and seeks wide diplomatic recognition and an eventual declaration
        of formal Taiwan independence. The Pan-Green camp tends to favour emphasizing
        the Republic of China as being a distinct country from the People''s Republic
        of China. Thus, in September 2007, the then ruling Democratic Progressive
        Party approved a resolution asserting separate identity from China and called
        for the enactment of a new constitution for a \"<i>normal country</i>\". It
        called also for general use of \"<i>Taiwan</i>\" as the country''s name, without
        abolishing its formal name, the \"Republic of China\". Some members of the
        coalition, such as former President Chen Shui-bian, argue that it is unnecessary
        to proclaim independence because \"Taiwan is already an independent, sovereign
        country\" and the Republic of China is the same as Taiwan. Despite being a
        member of KMT prior to and during his presidency, Lee Teng-hui also held a
        similar view and was a supporter of the Taiwanization movement.</p>\n<p>Pan-Blue
        members generally support the concept of the One-China policy, which states
        that there is only one China and that its only government is the ROC. They
        favour eventual re-unification of China. The more mainstream Pan-Blue position
        is to lift investment restrictions and pursue negotiations with the PRC to
        immediately open direct transportation links. Regarding independence, the
        mainstream Pan-Blue position is to maintain the status quo, while refusing
        immediate reunification. President Ma Ying-jeou stated that there will be
        no unification nor declaration of independence during his presidency. As of
        2009, Pan-Blue members usually seek to improve relationships with mainland
        China, with a current focus on improving economic ties.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Current_political_issues\">Current
        political issues</span></h3>\n<p>The dominant political issue in Taiwan is
        its relationship with the PRC. For almost 60\u00a0years, there were no direct
        transportation links, including direct flights, between Taiwan and mainland
        China. This was a problem for many Taiwanese businesses that had opened factories
        or branches in mainland China. The former DPP administration feared that such
        links would lead to tighter economic and political integration with mainland
        China, and in the 2006 Lunar New Year Speech, President Chen Shui-bian called
        for managed opening of links. Direct weekend charter flights between Taiwan
        and mainland China began in July 2008 under the current KMT government, and
        the first direct daily charter flights took off in December 2008.</p>\n<p>Other
        major political issues include the passage of an arms procurement bill that
        the United States authorized in 2001. In 2008, however, the United States
        was reluctant to send over more arms to Taiwan out of fear that it would hinder
        the recent improvement of ties between the PRC and the ROC. Another major
        political issue is the establishment of a National Communications Commission
        to take over from the Government Information Office, whose advertising budget
        exercised great control over the media.</p>\n<p>The politicians and their
        parties have themselves become major political issues. Corruption among some
        DPP administration officials has been exposed. In early 2006, President Chen
        Shui-bian was linked to possible corruption. The political effect on President
        Chen Shui-bian was great, causing a divide in the DPP leadership and supporters
        alike. It eventually led to the creation of a political camp led by ex-DPP
        leader Shih Ming-teh which believes the president should resign. The KMT assets
        continue to be another major issue, as it was once the richest political party
        in the world. Nearing the end of 2006, KMT''s chairman Ma Ying-jeou was also
        hit by corruption controversies, although he has since then been cleared of
        any wrongdoings by the courts. After completing his second term as President,
        Chen Shui-bian was charged with corruption and money laundering. Following
        his conviction, he is serving a 17-year sentence in Taipei Prison.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"National_identity\">National identity</span></h3>\n\n<p>Roughly 84% of
        Taiwan''s population descends from Han Chinese who migrated from Qing China
        between 1661 and 1895. Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese
        who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The
        shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical
        separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences,
        as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national
        identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratization
        and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed
        to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart
        of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland
        China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for
        <i>de jure</i> Taiwan independence. The pan-green camp supports a distinct
        Taiwanese identity, while the pan-blue camp supports a Chinese identity only.
        The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a
        Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.</p>\n<p>According to a survey
        conducted in March 2009, 49% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese
        only, and 44% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese and Chinese.
        3% consider themselves as only Chinese. Another survey, conducted in Taiwan
        in July 2009, showed that 82.8% of respondents consider the ROC and the PRC
        as two separate countries with each developing on its own. A survey conducted
        in December 2009 showed that 62% of the respondents consider themselves as
        Taiwanese only, and 22% of the respondents consider themselves as both Taiwanese
        and Chinese. 8% consider themselves as only Chinese. The survey also shows
        that among 18- to 29-year-old respondents, 75% consider themselves as Taiwanese
        only.</p>\n<p>In the latest survey conducted by National Chengchi University
        in 2014 and published in early 2015, 60.6% of respondents identified themselves
        exclusively as Taiwanese, 32.5% identified themselves as both Taiwanese and
        Chinese and 3.5% identified themselves as Chinese.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Military\">Military</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The
        Republic of China Army takes its roots in the National Revolutionary Army,
        which was established by Sun Yat-sen in 1925 in Guangdong with a goal of reunifying
        China under the Kuomintang. When the People''s Liberation Army won the Chinese
        Civil War, much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along
        with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army.
        Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded
        or incorporated into the People''s Liberation Army.</p>\n<p>Today, the Republic
        of China maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as
        defence against the constant threat of invasion by the PRC under the Anti-Secession
        Law of the People''s Republic of China. From 1949 to the 1970s, the primary
        mission of the military was to \"retake the mainland\" through Project National
        Glory. As this mission has shifted to defence, the ROC military has begun
        to shift emphasis from the traditionally dominant Army to the air force and
        navy.</p>\n<p>Control of the armed forces has also passed into the hands of
        the civilian government. As the ROC military shares historical roots with
        the KMT, the older generation of high-ranking officers tends to have Pan-Blue
        sympathies. However, many have retired and there are many more non-mainlanders
        enlisting in the armed forces in the younger generations, so the political
        leanings of the military have moved closer to the public norm in Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The
        ROC began a force reduction program, Jingshi An (translated to streamlining
        program), to scale down its military from a level of 450,000 in 1997 to 380,000
        in 2001. As of 2009, the armed forces of the ROC number approximately 300,000,
        with nominal reserves totalling 3.6\u00a0million as of 2005. Conscription
        remains universal for qualified males reaching age eighteen, but as a part
        of the reduction effort many are given the opportunity to fulfill their draft
        requirement through alternative service and are redirected to government agencies
        or defence related industries. Current plans call for a transition to a predominantly
        professional army over the next decade. Conscription periods are planned to
        decrease from 14\u00a0months to 12. In the last months of the Bush administration,
        Taipei took the decision to reverse the trend of declining defence spending,
        at a time when most Asian countries kept on reducing their military expenditures.
        It also decided to modernize both defensive and offensive capabilities. Taipei
        still keeps a large military apparatus relative to the island''s population:
        defence expenditures for 2008 were NTD 334 billion (approximately US $10.5
        billion), which accounted for 2.94% of GDP.</p>\n\n\n<p>The armed forces''
        primary concern at this time, according to the <i>National Defense Report</i>,
        is the possibility of an invasion by the PRC, consisting of a naval blockade,
        airborne assault, and/or missile bombardment. Four upgraded <i>Kidd</i>-class
        destroyers were purchased from the United States, and commissioned into the
        Republic of China Navy in 2005\u20132006, significantly upgrading Taiwan''s
        air defence and submarine hunting abilities. The Ministry of National Defense
        planned to purchase diesel-powered submarines and Patriot anti-missile batteries
        from the United States, but its budget has been stalled repeatedly by the
        opposition-Pan-Blue Coalition controlled legislature. The defence package
        was stalled from 2001 to 2007 where it was finally passed through the legislature
        and the US responded on 3 October 2008, with a $6.5\u00a0billion arms package
        including PAC III Anti-Air defence systems, AH-64D Apache Attack helicopters
        and other arms and parts. A significant amount of military hardware has been
        bought from the United States, and, as of 2009, continues to be legally guaranteed
        by the Taiwan Relations Act. In the past, France and the Netherlands have
        also sold military weapons and hardware to the ROC, but they almost entirely
        stopped in the 1990s under pressure of the PRC.</p>\n<p>The first line of
        defence against invasion by the PRC is the ROC''s own armed forces. Current
        ROC military doctrine is to hold out against an invasion or blockade until
        the US military responds. There is, however, no guarantee in the Taiwan Relations
        Act or any other treaty that the United States will defend Taiwan, even in
        the event of invasion. The joint declaration on security between the US and
        Japan signed in 1996 may imply that Japan would be involved in any response.
        However, Japan has refused to stipulate whether the \"area surrounding Japan\"
        mentioned in the pact includes Taiwan, and the precise purpose of the pact
        is unclear. The Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS
        Treaty) may mean that other US allies, such as Australia, could theoretically
        be involved. In practice, the risk of losing economic ties with China may
        prevent Australia from taking action. The United States, United Kingdom, Japan,
        South Korea, Australia, Canada, Chile, and Peru conduct maritime exercises
        in the Pacific Ocean every two years called RIMPAC. They are conducted to
        promote stability and to be able to respond in case of an armed conflict in
        the region \u2013 that includes an invasion of Taiwan by China.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Administrative_divisions\">Administrative divisions</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According
        to the 1947 constitution, the territory of the ROC is according to its \"existing
        national boundaries\". According to the Executive Yuan in 2012, Mongolia was
        re-recognized by Republic of China as an independent country when the constitution
        was announced in 1946.</p>\n<p>When the ROC retreated to Taiwan in 1949, its
        claimed territory consisted of 35 provinces, 12 special municipalities, 1
        special administrative region and 2 autonomous regions. However, since its
        retreat, the ROC has controlled only Taiwan Province and some islands of Fujian
        Province. The ROC also controls the Pratas Islands and Taiping Island in the
        Spratly Islands, which are part of the disputed South China Sea Islands. They
        were placed under Kaohsiung administration after the retreat to Taiwan.</p>\n<p>Since
        1949, the government has made some changes in the area under its control.
        Taipei became a special municipality in 1967 and Kaohsiung in 1979. The two
        provincial governments were \"streamlined\", with their functions transferred
        to the central government (Fujian in 1956 and Taiwan in 1998). In 2010, New
        Taipei, Taichung and Tainan were upgraded to special municipalities. And in
        2014, Taoyuan County was also upgraded to Taoyuan special municipality. This
        brought the top-level divisions to their current state:</p>\n<p>According
        to Article 4 of the Local Government Act, laws pertaining to special municipalities
        also apply to counties with a population exceeding 2 million. This provision
        does not currently apply to any county, although it previously applied to
        Taipei County (now New Taipei City) and Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City).</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Economy_and_industry\">Economy and industry</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The quick
        industrialization and rapid growth of Taiwan during the latter half of the
        20th century has been called the \"Taiwan Miracle\". Taiwan is one of the
        \"Four Asian Tigers\" alongside Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.</p>\n<p>Japanese
        rule prior to and during World War II brought changes in the public and private
        sectors, most notably in the area of public works, which enabled rapid communications
        and facilitated transport throughout much of the island. The Japanese also
        improved public education and made it compulsory for all residents of Taiwan.</p>\n<p>By
        1945, hyperinflation was in progress in mainland China and Taiwan as a result
        of the war with Japan. To isolate Taiwan from it, the Nationalist government
        created a new currency area for the island, and began a price stabilization
        program. These efforts significantly slowed inflation.</p>\n<p>When the KMT
        government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of taels (where 1\u00a0tael
        ~1.2\u00a0ozt) of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China,
        which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.
        Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought
        the intellectual and business elites from Mainland China. The KMT government
        instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted
        on mainland China. The government also implemented a policy of import-substitution,
        attempting to produce imported goods domestically.</p>\n<p>In 1950, with the
        outbreak of the Korean War, the United States began an aid program which resulted
        in fully stabilized prices by 1952. Economic development was encouraged by
        American economic aid and programs such as the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction,
        which turned the agricultural sector into the basis for later growth. Under
        the combined stimulus of the land reform and the agricultural development
        programs, agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 4
        per cent from 1952 to 1959, which was greater than the population growth,
        3.6%.</p>\n<p>In 1962, Taiwan had a (nominal) per-capita gross national product
        (GNP) of $170, placing its economy on a par with those of the Democratic Republic
        of the Congo. On a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, its GDP per capita
        in the early 1960s was $1,353 (in 1990 prices). By 2011 per-capita GNP, adjusted
        for purchasing power parity (PPP), had risen to $37,000, contributing to a
        Human Development Index (HDI) equivalent to that of other developed countries.
        Taiwan''s HDI in 2012 is 0.890, (23rd, very high), according to the UN''s
        new \"Inequality-adjusted HDI\" calculation method.</p>\n<p>In 1974, Chiang
        Ching-kuo implemented the Ten Major Construction Projects, the beginning foundations
        that helped Taiwan transform into its current export driven economy. Since
        the 1990s, a number of Taiwan-based technology firms have expanded their reach
        around the world. Well-known international technology companies headquartered
        in Taiwan include personal computer manufacturers Acer Inc. and Asus, mobile
        phone maker HTC, as well as electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn, which
        makes products for Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Computex Taipei is a major
        computer expo, held since 1981.</p>\n\n<p>Today Taiwan has a dynamic, capitalist,
        export-driven economy with gradually decreasing state involvement in investment
        and foreign trade. In keeping with this trend, some large government-owned
        banks and industrial firms are being privatized. Real growth in GDP has averaged
        about 8% during the past three decades. Exports have provided the primary
        impetus for industrialization. The trade surplus is substantial, and foreign
        reserves are the world''s fifth largest. The Republic of China has its own
        currency, the New Taiwan dollar.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the 1990s,
        the economic ties between Taiwan and the People''s Republic of China have
        been very prolific. As of 2008, more than US$150 billion have been invested
        in the PRC by Taiwanese companies, and about 10% of the Taiwanese labour force
        works in the PRC, often to run their own businesses. Although the economy
        of Taiwan benefits from this situation, some have expressed the view that
        the island has become increasingly dependent on the Mainland Chinese economy.
        A 2008 white paper by the Department of Industrial Technology states that
        \"Taiwan should seek to maintain stable relation with China while continuing
        to protect national security, and avoiding excessive ''Sinicization'' of Taiwanese
        economy.\" Others argue that close economic ties between Taiwan and Mainland
        China would make any military intervention by the PLA against Taiwan very
        costly, and therefore less probable.</p>\n<p>Taiwan''s total trade in 2010
        reached an all-time high of US$526.04 billion, according to Taiwan''s Ministry
        of Finance. Both exports and imports for the year reached record levels, totalling
        US$274.64 billion and US$251.4 billion, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, agriculture
        constituted only 2% of GDP, down from 35% in 1952. Traditional labour-intensive
        industries are steadily being moved offshore and with more capital and technology-intensive
        industries replacing them. High-technology industrial parks have sprung up
        in every region in Taiwan. The ROC has become a major foreign investor in
        the PRC, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. It is
        estimated that some 50,000\u00a0Taiwanese businesses and 1,000,000\u00a0businesspeople
        and their dependents are established in the PRC.</p>\n<p>Because of its conservative
        financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little
        compared with many of its neighbours from the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
        Unlike its neighbours, South Korea and Japan, the Taiwanese economy is dominated
        by small and medium-sized businesses, rather than the large business groups.
        The global economic downturn, however, combined with poor policy co-ordination
        by the new administration and increasing bad debts in the banking system,
        pushed Taiwan into recession in 2001, the first whole year of negative growth
        since 1947. Due to the relocation of many manufacturing and labour-intensive
        industries to the PRC, unemployment also reached a level not seen since the
        1970s oil crisis. This became a major issue in the 2004 presidential election.
        Growth averaged more than 4% in the 2002\u20132006 period and the unemployment
        rate fell below 4%.</p>\n<p>The ROC often joins international organizations
        (especially ones that also include the People''s Republic of China) under
        a politically neutral name. The ROC has been a member of governmental trade
        organizations such as the World Trade Organization under the name Separate
        Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei) since
        2002.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Transportation\">Transportation</span></h2>\n\n<p>The
        Ministry of Transportation and Communications of the Republic of China is
        the cabinet-level governing body of the transportation network in Taiwan.
        Taiwan has an extensive highway network, classified into five levels: national
        highways, provincial highways, county routes, township routes, and special
        routes, with the first four being common. Taiwan also has an extensive bus
        network, most of which are run by private bus companies. Inter-city rail services
        are provided by Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) and Taiwan High Speed
        Rail (THSR). Rapid transit systems include the Taipei Metro, Taoyuan Metro
        (incl. the Airport MRT) and Kaohsiung MRT, while Taichung Metro is under construction.
        Major airports include Taiwan Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, Taipei Songshan and Taichung.
        There are currently seven airlines in Taiwan, the largest ones being China
        Airlines and EVA Air. There are four international seaports: Keelung, Kaohsiung,
        Taichung, and Hualien.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Education,_research,_and_academia\"></span><span
        id=\"Education.2C_research.2C_and_academia\">Education, research, and academia</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The
        higher education system was established in Taiwan by Japan during the colonial
        period. However, after the Republic of China took over Taiwan from Japan in
        1945, the system was promptly replaced by the same system as in mainland China
        which mixed with features of the Chinese and American educational systems.</p>\n<p>Taiwan
        is well known for adhering to the Confucian paradigm of valuing education
        as a means to improve one''s socioeconomic position in Taiwanese society.
        Heavy investment and a cultural value for education has catapulted the resource
        poor nation consistently atop the global education rankings. Taiwan is one
        of the top-performing countries in reading literacy, maths and sciences. In
        2015, Taiwanese students achieved one of the world''s best results in mathematics,
        science and literacy, as tested by the Programme for International Student
        Assessment (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils'' scholastic
        performance. The strong scholastic and educational performance of Taiwanese
        students has prompted the nation to build a highly educated labour force that
        possesses a strong background in mathematics and science to cope with the
        current labor market demands of the 21st century.</p>\n<p>The Taiwanese education
        system has been praised for various reasons including its comparatively high
        test results and its major role in ushering Taiwan''s economic development
        while creating one of the world\u2019s most highly educated workforces. The
        country has also been praised for its high university entrance rate where
        the university acceptance rate has increased from around 20 percent before
        the 1970s to 49 percent in 1996 and over 90 percent since 2006, among the
        highest in Asia. The nation''s high university entrance rate has created a
        highly skilled workforce making Taiwan one of the most highly educated countries
        in the world with 68.5% of Taiwanese high school students going on to attend
        university. Taiwan has a high percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary
        education degree where 45 percent of Taiwanese aged 25\u201364 hold a bachelors
        degree or higher compared with the average of 33 percent among member countries
        of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). On the
        other hand, the system has been criticized for placing excessive pressure
        on students and eschewing creativity in favor of rote memorization. In addition,
        the system has been criticized for producing an excess supply of over-educated
        university graduates and a higher unemployment rate. With a large supply of
        university graduates seeking a limited demand of prestigious white collar
        jobs in an environment that is increasingly losing its competitive edge has
        led many degree holders ending up with lower end jobs with salaries far beneath
        than their expectations. Taiwan\u2019s universities have also been under criticism
        for not being able to fully meet the requirements and demands of Taiwan\u2019s
        21st century fast-moving job market citing a skills mismatch among a large
        number of self-assessed overeducated university graduates that don''t fit
        the demands of the modern Taiwanese labor market. The Taiwanese government
        has also been criticized for undermining the economy as it has been unable
        to produce enough jobs to meet the demands of numerous underemployed university
        graduates.</p>\n<p>As the Taiwanese economy is largely science and technology
        based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher
        education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain
        a competitive edge when searching for employment. Although current Taiwanese
        law mandates only nine years of schooling, 95% of junior high graduates go
        on to attend a senior vocational high school, university, junior college,
        trade school, or other higher education institution.</p>\n<p>Many Taiwanese
        students attend cram schools, or bushiban, to improve skills and knowledge
        on problem solving against exams of subjects like mathematics, nature science,
        history and many others. Courses are available for most popular subjects.
        Lessons are organized in lectures, reviews, private tutorial sessions, and
        recitations.</p>\n<p>As of 2013, the literacy rate in Taiwan is 97.15%.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Demographics\">Demographics</span></h2>\n\n<p>Taiwan''s population is
        about 23.4 million, most of whom are on the island proper. The remainder live
        on Penghu (101,758), Kinmen (127,723), and Matsu (12,506).</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Ethnic_groups\">Ethnic groups</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The ROC government
        reports that over 95% of the population is Han, of which the majority includes
        descendants of early Han Chinese immigrants who arrived in Taiwan in large
        numbers starting in the 18th century. Alternatively, the ethnic groups of
        Taiwan may be roughly divided among the Hoklo (70%), the Hakka (14%), the
        Waishengren (14%), and indigenous peoples (2%).</p>\n<p>The Hoklo people are
        the largest Han subgroup (70% of the total population), whose ancestors migrated
        from the coastal southern Fujian region across the Taiwan Strait starting
        in the 17th century. The Hakka comprise about 15% of the total population,
        and descend from Han migrants to Guangdong, its surrounding areas and Taiwan.
        Additional people of Han origin include and descend from the 2 million Nationalists
        who fled to Taiwan following the communist victory on the mainland in 1949.</p>\n<p>The
        indigenous Taiwanese aborigines number about 533,600 and are divided into
        16 recognized groups. The Ami, Atayal, Bunun, Kanakanavu, Kavalan, Paiwan,
        Puyuma, Rukai, Saisiyat, Saaroa, Sakizaya, Sediq, Thao, Truku and Tsou live
        mostly in the eastern half of the island, while the Yami inhabit Orchid Island.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Languages\">Languages</span></h3>\n\n<p>Mandarin is the official national
        language and is spoken by the vast majority of the population of Taiwan. It
        has been the primary language of instruction in schools since the end of Japanese
        rule. As in Hong Kong and Macau, Traditional Chinese is used as the writing
        system in Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The 70% of the population belonging to the Hoklo
        ethnic group speak Taiwanese Hokkien (a variant of the Min Nan speech of Fujian
        province) as their mother tongue, in addition to Mandarin, and many others
        have some degree of understanding. The Hakka ethnic group (15% of the population)
        use Hakka Chinese. Most <i>waishengren</i> speak primarily Mandarin. Although
        Mandarin is the language of instruction in schools and dominates television
        and radio, non-Mandarin Chinese varieties have undergone a revival in public
        life in Taiwan, particularly since restrictions on their use were lifted in
        the 1990s.</p>\n<p>Taiwan''s indigenous languages, the Formosan languages,
        do not belong to the Chinese or Sino-Tibetan language family, but rather to
        the Austronesian language family. Their use among Taiwan''s aboriginal minority
        groups has been in decline as usage of Mandarin has risen. Of the 14 extant
        languages, five are considered moribund.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Religion\">Religion</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        Constitution of the Republic of China protects people''s freedom of religion
        and the practices of belief. There are approximately 18,718,600 religious
        followers in Taiwan as of 2005 (81.3% of total population) and 14\u201318%
        are non-religious. According to the 2005 census, of the 26 religions recognized
        by the ROC government, the five largest are: Buddhism (8,086,000 or 35.1%),
        Taoism (7,600,000 or 33%), Yiguandao (810,000 or 3.5%), Protestantism (605,000
        or 2.6%), and Roman Catholicism (298,000 or 1.3%).</p>\n<p>The CIA World Factbook
        reports that over 93% of Taiwanese are adherents of a combination of the polytheistic
        Chinese popular religion, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism; 4.5% are adherents
        of Christianity, which includes Protestants, Catholics, and other, non-denominational,
        Christian groups; and less than 2.5% are adherents of other religions. Taiwanese
        aborigines comprise a notable subgroup among professing Christians: \"...over
        64% identify as Christian... Church buildings are the most obvious markers
        of Aboriginal villages, distinguishing them from Taiwanese or Hakka villages.\"</p>\n<p>Confucianism
        is a philosophy that deals with secular moral ethics, and serves as the foundation
        of both Chinese and Taiwanese culture. The majority of Taiwanese people usually
        combine the secular moral teachings of Confucianism with whatever religions
        they are affiliated with.</p>\n<p>As of 2009, there were 14,993 temples in
        Taiwan, approximately one place of worship per 1,500 residents. 9,202 of those
        temples were dedicated to Taoism. In 2008, Taiwan had 3,262 Churches, an increase
        of 145.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Largest_cities\">Largest cities</span></h3>\n\n<p>The
        figures below are the 2011 estimates for the twenty largest urban populations
        within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering
        the total metropolitan area populations (in such rankings the Taipei-Keelung
        metro area is by far the largest agglomeration).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h2><span
        id=\"Public_health\">Public health</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>Health care in Taiwan
        is managed by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI).</p>\n<p>The
        current program was implemented in 1995, and is considered to be a form of
        social insurance. The government health insurance program maintains compulsory
        insurance for citizens who are employed, impoverished, unemployed, or victims
        of natural disasters with fees that correlate to the individual and/or family
        income; it also maintains protection for non-citizens working in Taiwan. A
        standardized method of calculation applies to all persons and can optionally
        be paid by an employer or by individual contributions.</p>\n<p>BNHI insurance
        coverage requires co-payment at the time of service for most services unless
        it is a preventative health service, for low-income families, veterans, children
        under three years old, or in the case of catastrophic diseases. Low income
        households maintain 100% premium coverage by the BNHI and co-pays are reduced
        for disabled or certain elderly people.</p>\n<p>According to a recently published
        survey, out of 3,360\u00a0patients surveyed at a randomly chosen hospital,
        75.1% of the patients said they are \"very satisfied\" with the hospital service;
        20.5% said they are \"okay\" with the service. Only 4.4% of the patients said
        they are either \"not satisfied\" or \"very not satisfied\" with the service
        or care provided.</p>\n<p>Taiwan has its own Center for Disease Control, and
        during the SARS outbreak in March 2003 there were 347\u00a0confirmed cases.
        During the outbreak the Centers for Disease Control and local governments
        set up monitored stations throughout public transportation, recreational sites
        and other public areas. With full containment in July 2003, there has not
        been a case of SARS since.</p>\n<p>As of 2006, the BNHI Facility Contract
        Distribution facilities total 17,259, including:</p>\n<p>Basic coverage areas
        of the insurance include:</p>\n<p>In 2004, the infant mortality rate was 5.3
        with 15\u00a0physicians and 63\u00a0hospital beds per 10,000\u00a0people.
        The life expectancy for males was 73.5\u00a0years and 79.7\u00a0years for
        females according to the World Health Report.</p>\n<p>In July 2013, the Department
        of Health was restructured as the Ministry of Health and Welfare.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Culture\">Culture</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The cultures of Taiwan are a hybrid
        blend of various sources, incorporating elements of traditional Chinese culture,
        attributable to the historical and ancestry origin of the majority of its
        current residents, Japanese culture, traditional Confucianist beliefs, and
        increasingly Western values.</p>\n<p>After their move to Taiwan, the Kuomintang
        imposed an official interpretation of traditional Chinese culture over Taiwan.
        The government launched a program promoting Chinese calligraphy, traditional
        Chinese painting, folk art, and Chinese opera.</p>\n<p>The status of Taiwanese
        culture is debated. It is disputed whether Taiwanese culture is a regional
        form of Chinese culture or a distinct culture. Reflecting the continuing controversy
        surrounding the political status of Taiwan, politics continues to play a role
        in the conception and development of a Taiwanese cultural identity, especially
        in the prior dominant frame of a Taiwanese and Chinese dualism. In recent
        years, the concept of Taiwanese multiculturalism has been proposed as a relatively
        apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders
        and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture
        as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought
        and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan. Identity politics, along with
        the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has
        led to distinct traditions in many areas, including cuisine and music.</p>\n\n<p>One
        of Taiwan''s greatest attractions is the National Palace Museum, which houses
        more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting, and
        porcelain and is considered one of the greatest collections of Chinese art
        and objects in the world. The KMT moved this collection from the Forbidden
        City in Beijing in 1933 and part of the collection was eventually transported
        to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. The collection, estimated to be one-tenth
        of China''s cultural treasures, is so extensive that only 1% is on display
        at any time. The PRC had said that the collection was stolen and has called
        for its return, but the ROC has long defended its control of the collection
        as a necessary act to protect the pieces from destruction, especially during
        the Cultural Revolution. Relations regarding this treasure have warmed recently;
        Beijing Palace Museum Curator Zheng Xinmiao said that artefacts in both Chinese
        and Taiwanese museums are \"China''s cultural heritage jointly owned by people
        across the Taiwan Strait.\"</p>\n<p>The classical music culture in Taiwan
        is highly developed and features artists such as violinist Cho-Liang Lin,
        pianist Ching-Yun Hu, and the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society Artist
        Director Wu Han. Karaoke, drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely
        popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like
        style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms varying on the number of guests
        in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to
        form all-encompassing elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or
        businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV''s, equipped
        not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment
        counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the
        city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theatre
        room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a
        place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.</p>\n<p>Taiwan
        has a high density of 24-hour convenience stores, which, in addition to the
        usual services, provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government
        agencies such as collection of parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation
        fines, and credit card payments. They also provide a service for mailing packages.</p>\n<p>Taiwanese
        culture has also influenced other cultures. Bubble tea and milk tea are available
        in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Taiwan television
        shows are popular in Singapore, Malaysia, and other Asian countries. Taiwanese
        films have won various international awards at film festivals around the world.
        Ang Lee, a Taiwanese director, has directed critically acclaimed films such
        as: <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>; <i>Eat Drink Man Woman</i>; <i>Sense
        and Sensibility</i>; <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>; <i>Life of Pi</i>; and <i>Lust,
        Caution</i>. Other famous Taiwanese directors include Tsai Ming-Liang, Edward
        Yang, and Hou Hsiao-hsien.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sports\">Sports</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Baseball
        is Taiwan''s national sport and it is a popular spectator sport. Two of the
        most famous Taiwanese baseball pitchers are Chien-Ming Wang and Wei-Yin Chen;
        both are pitchers in Major League Baseball. Other notable players playing
        in the United States include Chin-hui Tsao who played for the Colorado Rockies
        (2003\u20132005) and the Los Angeles Dodgers (2007, 2015\u20132016), Hong-Chih
        Kuo, Fu-Te Ni, and Chin-lung Hu. The Chinese Professional Baseball League
        in Taiwan was established in 1989, and eventually absorbed the competing Taiwan
        Major League in 2003. As of 2015, the CPBL has four teams with average attendance
        over 5,000 per game.</p>\n<p>Besides baseball, basketball is Taiwan''s major
        sport. Taekwondo has also become a mature and successful sport in recent years.
        In the 2004 Olympics, Chen Shih-hsin and Chu Mu-yen won the first two gold
        medals in women''s flyweight event and men''s flyweight event, respectively.
        Subsequent taekwondo competitors such as Yang Shu-chun have strengthened Taiwan''s
        taekwondo culture.</p>\n<p>Taiwan participates in international sporting organizations
        and events under the name of \"Chinese Taipei\" due to its political status.
        In 2009, Taiwan hosted two international sporting events on the island. The
        World Games 2009 were held in Kaohsiung between 16 and 26 July 2009. Taipei
        hosted the 21st Summer Deaflympics in September of the same year. Furthermore,
        Taipei will host the Summer Universiade in 2017.</p>\n<p>Taiwan is also a
        major Asian country for Korfball. In 2008, Taiwan hosted the World Youth Korfball
        Championship and took the silver medal. In 2009, Taiwan''s korfball team won
        a bronze medal at the World Game.</p>\n<p>Yani Tseng is the most famous Taiwanese
        professional golfer currently playing on the US-based LPGA Tour. She is the
        youngest player ever, male or female, to win five major championships and
        had been ranked number 1 in the Women''s World Golf Rankings for 109 consecutive
        weeks from 2011 to 2013.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Calendar\">Calendar</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taiwan
        uses two official calendars: the Gregorian calendar and the Minguo calendar.
        The latter numbers years starting from 1911, the year of the founding of the
        Republic of China. For example, 2007 was the \"96th year of the Republic\"
        (\u6c11\u570b96\u5e74), while its months and days were numbered according
        to the Gregorian calendar.</p>\n<p>Usually, year numbering may use the Gregorian
        system as well as the ROC era system. For example, 3 May 2004, may be written
        2004-05-03 or 93-05-03. The use of two different calendar systems in Taiwan
        may be confusing, in particular for foreigners. For instance, products for
        export marked using the Minguo calendar can be misunderstood as having an
        expiration date 11\u00a0years earlier than intended.</p>\n<p>Taiwan also uses
        the lunar calendar for traditional festivals such as the Chinese New Year,
        the Lantern Festival, and the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See

        officially the <b>Republic of China</b> (<b>ROC</b>), is a state in East Asia.
        Its neighbors include the People''s Republic of China to the west, Japan to
        the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous
        state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations.</p>\n<p>The
        island of Taiwan, formerly known as Formosa, was inhabited by Taiwanese aborigines
        before the 17th century, when Dutch and Spanish colonies opened the island
        to mass Han immigration. After a brief rule by the Kingdom of Tungning, the
        island was annexed by the Qing dynasty, the last dynasty of China. The Qing
        ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895 after the Sino-Japanese War. While Taiwan was
        under Japanese rule, the Republic of China (ROC) was established on the mainland
        in 1912 after the fall of the Qing dynasty. Following the Japanese surrender
        to the Allies in 1945, the ROC took control of Taiwan. However, the resumption
        of the Chinese Civil War led to the ROC''s loss of the mainland to the Communists,
        and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949. Although the ROC continued
        to claim to be the legitimate government of China, its effective jurisdiction
        has, since the loss of Hainan in 1950, been limited to Taiwan and its surrounding
        islands, with the main island making up 99% of its <i>de facto</i> territory.
        As a founding member of the United Nations, the ROC continued to represent
        China at the United Nations until 1971, when the PRC assumed China''s seat,
        causing the ROC to lose its UN membership.</p>\n<p>In the early 1960s, Taiwan
        entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialization, creating
        a stable industrial economy. In the 1980s and early 1990s, it changed from
        a one-party military dictatorship dominated by the Kuomintang to a multi-party
        democracy with a semi-presidential system. Taiwan is the 22nd-largest economy
        in the world, and its high-tech industry plays a key role in the global economy.
        It is ranked highly in terms of freedom of the press, healthcare, public education,
        economic freedom, and human development. The country benefits from a highly
        skilled workforce and is among the most highly educated countries in the world
        with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education
        degree.</p>\n<p>The PRC has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and
        asserted the ROC is no longer in legitimate existence. Under its One-China
        Policy the PRC refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes
        the ROC. Today 20 countries maintain official ties with the ROC but many other
        states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices and institutions
        that function as <i>de facto</i> embassies and consulates. Although Taiwan
        is fully self-governing, most international organizations in which the PRC
        participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate
        only as a non-state actor. Internally, the major division in politics is between
        the aspirations of eventual Chinese unification or Taiwanese independence,
        though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal.
        The PRC has threatened the use of military force in response to any formal
        declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful
        unification is no longer possible.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n\n<p>There
        are various names for the island of Taiwan in use today, derived from explorers
        or rulers by each particular period. The former name Formosa (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u798f\u723e\u6469\u6c99</span>)
        dates from 1542, when Portuguese sailors sighted the main island of Taiwan
        and named it <i>Ilha Formosa</i>, which means \"beautiful island\". The name
        \"Formosa\" eventually \"replaced all others in European literature\" and
        was in common use in English in the early 20th century.</p>\n<p>In the early
        17th century, the Dutch East India Company established a commercial post at
        Fort Zeelandia (modern-day Anping, Tainan) on a coastal sandbar called \"Tayouan\",
        after their ethnonym for a nearby Taiwanese aboriginal tribe, written by the
        Dutch and Portuguese variously as <i>Taiouwang</i>, <i>Tayowan</i>, <i>Teijoan</i>,
        etc. This name was also adopted into the Chinese vernacular (in particular,
        Hokkien, as Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: <i><span lang=\"nan\">T\u0101i-o\u00e2n/T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n</span></i>)
        as the name of the sandbar and nearby area (Tainan). The modern word \"Taiwan\"
        is derived from this usage, which is seen in various forms (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u5927\u54e1,
        \u5927\u5713, \u5927\u7063, \u81fa\u54e1, \u81fa\u5713</span> and <span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u81fa\u7aa9\u7063</span>)
        in Chinese historical records. The area of modern-day Tainan was the first
        permanent settlement by Western colonists and Chinese immigrants, grew to
        be the most important trading centre, and served as the capital of the island
        until 1887. Use of the current Chinese name (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u81fa\u7063</span>)
        was formalized as early as 1684 with the establishment of Taiwan Prefecture.
        Through its rapid development, the entire Formosan mainland eventually became
        known as \"Taiwan\".</p>\n<p>In his <i>Daoyi Zhil\u00fce</i> (1349), Wang
        Dayuan used \"Liuqiu\" as a name for the island of Taiwan, or the part of
        it near to Penghu. Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in
        general or Okinawa, the largest of them; indeed the name <i>Ry\u016bky\u016b</i>
        is the Japanese form of <i>Li\u00faqi\u00fa</i>. The name also appears in
        the <i>Book of Sui</i> (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree
        on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even Luzon.</p>\n<p>The
        official name of the state is the \"Republic of China\"; it has also been
        known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC''s
        establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland,
        the government used the short form \"China\" <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3</span></i>
        <span>(<span lang=\"zh\">\u4e2d\u570b</span>),</span> to refer to itself,
        which derives from <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">zh\u014dng</span></i>
        (\"central\" or \"middle\") and <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">gu\u00f3</span></i>
        (\"state, nation-state\"),  A term which also developed under the Zhou Dynasty
        in reference to its royal demesne and the name was then applied to the area
        around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China''s
        Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under
        the Qingera . During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had fled to
        Taiwan due to losing the Chinese Civil War, it was commonly referred to as
        \"<b>Nationalist China</b>\" (or \"Free China\") to differentiate it from
        \"Communist China\" (or \"Red China\"). It was a member of the United Nations
        representing \"<i>China</i>\" until 1971, when it lost its seat to the People''s
        Republic of China. Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become
        commonly known as \"Taiwan\", after the island that comprises 99% of the territory
        under its control. In some contexts, especially official ones from the ROC
        government, the name is written as \"Republic of China (Taiwan)\", \"Republic
        of China/Taiwan\", or sometimes \"Taiwan (ROC).\" The Republic of China participates
        in most international forums and organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei\"
        due to diplomatic pressure from the People''s Republic of China. For instance,
        it is the name under which it has competed at the Olympic Games since 1984,
        and its name as an observer at the World Health Organization.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Prehistoric_Taiwan\">Prehistoric
        Taiwan</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Taiwan was joined to the mainland in the Late Pleistocene,
        until sea levels rose about 10,000 years ago. Fragmentary human remains dated
        20,000 to 30,000 years ago have been found on the island, as well as later
        artefacts of a Paleolithic culture.</p>\n<p>Around 6,000 years ago, Taiwan
        was settled by farmers, most likely from mainland China. They are believed
        to be the ancestors of today''s Taiwanese aborigines, whose languages belong
        to the Austronesian language family, but show much greater diversity than
        the rest of the family, which spans a huge area from Maritime Southeast Asia
        west to Madagascar and east as far as New Zealand, Hawaii and Easter Island.
        This has led linguists to propose Taiwan as the urheimat of the family, from
        which seafaring peoples dispersed across Southeast Asia and the Pacific and
        Indian Oceans.</p>\n<p>Han Chinese fishermen began settling in the Penghu
        islands in the 13th century. Hostile tribes, and a lack of valuable trade
        products, meant that few outsiders visited the main island until the 16th
        century. By the 1700''s visits to the coast by fishermen from Fujian, as well
        as Chinese and Japanese pirates, became more frequent.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Opening_in_the_17th_century\">Opening
        in the 17th century</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The Dutch East India Company attempted
        to establish a trading outpost on the Penghu Islands (Pescadores) in 1622,
        but were militarily defeated and driven off by the Ming authorities.</p>\n<p>In
        1624, the company established a stronghold called Fort Zeelandia on the coastal
        islet of Tayouan, which is now part of the main island at Anping, Tainan.
        David Wright, a Scottish agent of the company who lived on the island in the
        1650s, described the lowland areas of the island as being divided among 11
        chiefdoms ranging in size from two settlements to 72. Some of these fell under
        Dutch control, while others remained independent. The Company began to import
        labourers from Fujian and Penghu (Pescadores), many of whom settled.</p>\n<p>In
        1626, the Spanish Empire landed on and occupied northern Taiwan, at the ports
        of Keelung and Tamsui, as a base to extend their trading. This colonial period
        lasted 16 years until 1642, when the last Spanish fortress fell to Dutch forces.</p>\n<p>Following
        the fall of the Ming dynasty, Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), a self-styled Ming
        loyalist, arrived on the island and captured Fort Zeelandia in 1662, expelling
        the Dutch Empire and military from the island. Koxinga established the Kingdom
        of Tungning (1662\u20131683), with his capital at Tainan. He and his heirs,
        Zheng Jing, who ruled from 1662 to 1682, and Zheng Keshuang, who ruled less
        than a year, continued to launch raids on the southeast coast of mainland
        China well into the Qing dynasty era.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Qing_rule\">Qing
        rule</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>In 1683, following the defeat of Koxinga''s grandson
        by an armada led by Admiral Shi Lang of southern Fujian, the Qing dynasty
        formally annexed Taiwan, placing it under the jurisdiction of Fujian province.
        The Qing imperial government tried to reduce piracy and vagrancy in the area,
        issuing a series of edicts to manage immigration and respect aboriginal land
        rights. Immigrants mostly from southern Fujian continued to enter Taiwan.
        The border between taxpaying lands and \"savage\" lands shifted eastward,
        with some aborigines becoming sinicized while others retreated into the mountains.
        During this time, there were a number of conflicts between groups of Han Chinese
        from different regions of southern Fujian, particularly between those from
        Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, and between southern Fujian Chinese and aborigines.</p>\n<p>Northern
        Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were the scene of subsidiary campaigns in the
        Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885). The French occupied Keelung on
        1 October 1884, but were repulsed from Tamsui a few days later. The French
        won some tactical victories but were unable to exploit them, and the Keelung
        Campaign ended in stalemate. The Pescadores Campaign, beginning on 31 March
        1885, was a French victory, but had no long-term consequences. The French
        evacuated both Keelung and the Penghu archipelago after the end of the war.</p>\n<p>In
        1887, the Qing upgraded the island''s administration from Taiwan Prefecture
        of Fujian to Fujian-Taiwan-Province (\u798f\u5efa\u81fa\u7063\u7701), the
        twentieth in the empire, with its capital at Taipei. This was accompanied
        by a modernization drive that included building China''s first railroad.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Japanese_rule\">Japanese rule</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>As the Qing dynasty
        was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895), Taiwan, along
        with Penghu and Liaodong Peninsula, were ceded in full sovereignty to the
        Empire of Japan by the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Inhabitants on Taiwan and Penghu
        wishing to remain Qing subjects were given a two-year grace period to sell
        their property and move to mainland China. Very few Taiwanese saw this as
        feasible. On 25 May 1895, a group of pro-Qing high officials proclaimed the
        Republic of Formosa to resist impending Japanese rule. Japanese forces entered
        the capital at Tainan and quelled this resistance on 21 October 1895. Guerrilla
        fighting continued periodically until about 1902 and ultimately took the lives
        of 14,000 Taiwanese, or 0.5% of the population. Several subsequent rebellions
        against the Japanese (the Beipu uprising of 1907, the Tapani incident of 1915,
        and the Musha incident of 1930) were all unsuccessful but demonstrated opposition
        to Japanese colonial rule.</p>\n<p>Japanese colonial rule was instrumental
        in the industrialization of the island, extending the railroads and other
        transportation networks, building an extensive sanitation system, and establishing
        a formal education system. Japanese rule ended the practice of headhunting.
        During this period the human and natural resources of Taiwan were used to
        aid the development of Japan and the production of cash crops such as rice
        and sugar greatly increased. By 1939, Taiwan was the seventh greatest sugar
        producer in the world. Still, the Taiwanese and aborigines were classified
        as second- and third-class citizens. After suppressing Chinese guerrillas
        in the first decade of their rule, Japanese authorities engaged in a series
        of bloody campaigns against the mountain aboriginals, culminating in the Musha
        Incident of 1930. Intellectuals and laborers who participated in left-wing
        movements within Taiwan were also arrested and massacred (e.g. Tsi\u00fann
        U\u012b-Su\u00ed(\u8523\u6e2d\u6c34), Masanosuke Watanabe (\u6e21\u8fba\u653f\u4e4b\u8f85)).</p>\n<p>Around
        1935, the Japanese began an island-wide assimilation project to bind the island
        more firmly to the Japanese Empire and people were taught to see themselves
        as Japanese under the Kominka Movement, during which time Taiwanese culture
        and religion were outlawed and the citizens were encouraged to adopt Japanese
        surnames. The \"South Strike Group\" was based at the Taihoku Imperial University
        in Taipei. During World War II, tens of thousands of Taiwanese served in the
        Japanese military. For example, former ROC President Lee Teng-hui''s elder
        brother served in the Japanese navy and was killed in action in the Philippines
        in February 1945. The Imperial Japanese Navy operated heavily out of Taiwanese
        ports. In October 1944, the Formosa Air Battle was fought between American
        carriers and Japanese forces based in Taiwan. Important Japanese military
        bases and industrial centres throughout Taiwan, like Kaohsiung, were targets
        of heavy American bombings. Also during this time, over 2,000 women were forced
        into sexual slavery for Imperial Japanese troops, now euphemistically called
        \"comfort women.\"</p>\n<p>In 1938, there were 309,000 Japanese settlers in
        Taiwan. After World War II, most of the Japanese were expelled and sent to
        Japan.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Republic_of_China\">Republic of China</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During
        Japanese rule of Taiwan, on 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was declared
        with Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (the KMT or Nationalist Party) was proclaimed
        provisional president following the Xinhai Revolution, which itself began
        with the Wuchang Uprising on 10 October 1911, overthrowing the Qing Dynasty
        and ending over two thousand years of imperial rule in China. However, the
        presidency was later given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general who in 1915
        proclaimed himself Emperor of China. In the face of popular condemnation and
        opposition from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to abdicate and re-establish
        the republic.</p>\n<p>Since its founding until 1949 it was based on mainland
        China. Central authority waxed and waned in response to warlordism (1915\u201328)
        after Yuan Shikai''s death in 1916,, Japanese invasion (1937\u201345), and
        the Chinese Civil War (1927\u201349), with central authority strongest during
        the Nanjing Decade (1927\u201337), when most of China came under the control
        of the Kuomintang (KMT) under an authoritarian one-party state.</p>\n<p>After
        the Surrender of Japan, on 25 October 1945, the US Navy ferried ROC troops
        to Taiwan in order to accept the formal surrender of Japanese military forces
        in Taipei on behalf of the Allied Powers, as part of General Order No. 1 for
        temporary military occupation. General Rikichi And\u014d, governor-general
        of Taiwan and commander-in-chief of all Japanese forces on the island, signed
        the receipt and handed it over to General Chen Yi of the ROC military to complete
        the official turnover. Chen Yi proclaimed that day to be \"Taiwan Retrocession
        Day\", but the Allies considered Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to be under
        military occupation and still under Japanese sovereignty until 1952, when
        the Treaty of San Francisco took effect. Although the 1943 Cairo Declaration
        had envisaged returning these territories to China, in the Treaty of San Francisco
        and Treaty of Taipei Japan has renounced all claim to them without specifying
        to what country they were to be surrendered. This introduced the problem of
        the legal status of Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The ROC administration of Taiwan under
        Chen Yi was strained by increasing tensions between Taiwanese-born people
        and newly arrived mainlanders, which were compounded by economic woes, such
        as hyperinflation. Furthermore, cultural and linguistic conflicts between
        the two groups quickly led to the loss of popular support for the new government,
        while the mass movement led by the working committee of the Communist Party
        also aimed to bring down the Kuomintang government. The shooting of a civilian
        on 28 February 1947 triggered island-wide unrest, which was suppressed with
        military force in what is now called the February 28 Incident. Mainstream
        estimates of the number killed range from 18,000 to 30,000. Those killed were
        mainly members of the Taiwanese elite.</p>\n\n<p>After the end of World War
        II, the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Chinese Nationalists (Kuomintang),
        led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong.
        Throughout the months of 1949, a series of Chinese Communist offensives led
        to the capture of its capital Nanjing on 23 April and the subsequent defeat
        of the Nationalist army on the mainland, and the Communists founded the People''s
        Republic of China on 1 October.</p>\n<p>On 7 December 1949, after the loss
        of four capitals, Chiang evacuated his Nationalist government to Taiwan and
        made Taipei the temporary capital of the ROC (also called the \"wartime capital\"
        by Chiang Kai-shek). Some 2 million people, consisting mainly of soldiers,
        members of the ruling Kuomintang and intellectual and business elites, were
        evacuated from mainland China to Taiwan at that time, adding to the earlier
        population of approximately six million. In addition, the ROC government took
        to Taipei many national treasures and much of China''s gold reserves and foreign
        currency reserves.</p>\n<p>After losing most of the mainland, the Kuomintang
        held remaining control of Tibet, the portions of Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Yunnan
        provinces along with the Hainan Island until 1951 before the Communists subsequently
        captured both territories. From this point onwards, the Kuomintang''s territory
        was reduced to Taiwan, Penghu, the portions of the Fujian province (Kinmen
        and Matsu Islands), and two major islands of Dongsha Islands and Nansha Islands.
        The Kuomintang continued to claim sovereignty over all \"China\", which it
        defined to include mainland China, Taiwan, Outer Mongolia and other areas.
        On mainland China, the victorious Communists claimed they ruled the sole and
        only China (which they claimed included Taiwan) and that the Republic of China
        no longer existed.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"Chinese_Nationalist_one-party_rule\">Chinese
        Nationalist one-party rule</span></h4>\n<p>Martial law, declared on Taiwan
        in May 1949, continued to be in effect after the central government relocated
        to Taiwan. It was not repealed until 1987, and was used as a way to suppress
        the political opposition in the intervening years. During the White Terror,
        as the period is known, 140,000 people were imprisoned or executed for being
        perceived as anti-KMT or pro-Communist. Many citizens were arrested, tortured,
        imprisoned and executed for their real or perceived link to the Communists.
        Since these people were mainly from the intellectual and social elite, an
        entire generation of political and social leaders was decimated. In 1998 law
        was passed to create the \"Compensation Foundation for Improper Verdicts\"
        which oversaw compensation to White Terror victims and families. President
        Ma Ying-jeou made an official apology in 2008, expressing hope that there
        will never be a tragedy similar to White Terror.</p>\n<p>Initially, the United
        States abandoned the KMT and expected that Taiwan would fall to the Communists.
        However, in 1950 the conflict between North Korea and South Korea, which had
        been ongoing since the Japanese withdrawal in 1945, escalated into full-blown
        war, and in the context of the Cold War, US President Harry S. Truman intervened
        again and dispatched the US Navy''s 7th Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent
        hostilities between Taiwan and mainland China. In the Treaty of San Francisco
        and the Treaty of Taipei, which came into force respectively on 28 April 1952
        and 5 August 1952, Japan formally renounced all right, claim and title to
        Taiwan and Penghu, and renounced all treaties signed with China before 1942.
        Neither treaty specified to whom sovereignty over the islands should be transferred,
        because the United States and the United Kingdom disagreed on whether the
        ROC or the PRC was the legitimate government of China. Continuing conflict
        of the Chinese Civil War through the 1950s, and intervention by the United
        States notably resulted in legislation such as the Sino-American Mutual Defense
        Treaty and the Formosa Resolution of 1955.</p>\n\n<p>As the Chinese Civil
        War continued without truce, the government built up military fortifications
        throughout Taiwan. Within this effort, KMT veterans built the now famous Central
        Cross-Island Highway through the Taroko Gorge in the 1950s. The two sides
        would continue to engage in sporadic military clashes with seldom publicized
        details well into the 1960s on the China coastal islands with an unknown number
        of night raids. During the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in September 1958,
        Taiwan''s landscape saw Nike-Hercules missile batteries added, with the formation
        of the 1st Missile Battalion Chinese Army that would not be deactivated until
        1997. Newer generations of missile batteries have since replaced the Nike
        Hercules systems throughout the island.</p>\n<p>During the 1960s and 1970s,
        the ROC maintained an authoritarian, single-party government while its economy
        became industrialized and technology oriented. This rapid economic growth,
        known as the Taiwan Miracle, was the result of a fiscal regime independent
        from mainland China and backed up, among others, by the support of US funds
        and demand for Taiwanese products. In the 1970s, Taiwan was economically the
        second fastest growing state in Asia after Japan. Taiwan, along with Hong
        Kong, South Korea and Singapore, became known as one of the Four Asian Tigers.
        Because of the Cold War, most Western nations and the United Nations regarded
        the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China until the 1970s. Later,
        especially after the termination of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty,
        most nations switched diplomatic recognition to the PRC (see United Nations
        General Assembly Resolution 2758).</p>\n<p>Up until the 1970s, the government
        was regarded by Western critics as undemocratic for upholding martial law,
        for severely repressing any political opposition and for controlling media.
        The KMT did not allow the creation of new parties and those that existed did
        not seriously compete with the KMT. Thus, competitive democratic elections
        did not exist. From the late 1970s to the 1990s, however, Taiwan went through
        reforms and social changes that transformed it from an authoritarian state
        to a democracy. In 1979, a pro-democracy protest known as the Kaohsiung Incident
        took place in Kaohsiung to celebrate Human Rights Day. Although the protest
        was rapidly crushed by the authorities, it is today considered as the main
        event that united Taiwan''s opposition.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Democratization\">Democratization</span></h4>\n\n<p>Chiang
        Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek''s son and successor as the president, began to
        liberalize the political system in the mid-1980s. In 1984, the younger Chiang
        selected Lee Teng-hui, a Taiwanese-born, US-educated technocrat, to be his
        vice-president. In 1986, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was formed
        and inaugurated as the first opposition party in the ROC to counter the KMT.
        A year later, Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law on the main island of Taiwan
        (martial law was lifted on Penghu in 1979, Matsu island in 1992 and Kinmen
        island in 1993). With the advent of democratization, the issue of the political
        status of Taiwan gradually resurfaced as a controversial issue where, previously,
        the discussion of anything other than unification under the ROC was taboo.</p>\n<p>After
        the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, Lee Teng-hui succeeded him
        as president. Lee continued to democratize the government and decrease the
        concentration of government authority in the hands of mainland Chinese. Under
        Lee, Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which Taiwanese culture
        and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint in contrast to earlier
        KMT policies which had promoted a Chinese identity. Lee''s reforms included
        printing banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of
        Taiwan, and streamlining the Taiwan Provincial Government with most of its
        functions transferred to the Executive Yuan. Under Lee, the original members
        of the Legislative Yuan and National Assembly(a former supreme legislative
        body defunct in 2005\uff09, elected in 1947 to represent mainland Chinese
        constituencies and having held the seats without re-election for more than
        four decades, were forced to resign in 1991. The previously nominal representation
        in the Legislative Yuan was brought to an end, reflecting the reality that
        the ROC had no jurisdiction over mainland China, and vice versa. Restrictions
        on the use of Taiwanese Hokkien in the broadcast media and in schools were
        also lifted.</p>\n\n<p>Democratic reforms continued in the 1990s, with Lee
        Teng-hui re-elected in 1996, in the first direct presidential election in
        the history of the ROC. During the later years of Lee''s administration, he
        was involved in corruption controversies relating to government release of
        land and weapons purchase, although no legal proceedings commenced. In 1997,\"To
        meet the requisites of the nation prior to national unification\", the Additional
        Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China was passed and then
        the former \"constitution of five powers\" turns to be more tripartite. In
        2000, Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party was elected as the
        first non-Kuomintang (KMT) President and was re-elected to serve his second
        and last term since 2004. Polarized politics has emerged in Taiwan with the
        formation of the Pan-Blue Coalition of parties led by the KMT, favouring eventual
        Chinese reunification, and the Pan-Green Coalition of parties led by the DPP,
        favouring an eventual and official declaration of Taiwanese independence.
        In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian remarked: \u201cThe National Unification
        Council will cease to function. No budget will be ear-marked for it and its
        personnel must return to their original posts...The National Unification Guidelines
        will cease to apply.\"</p>\n\n<p>On 30 September 2007, the ruling DPP approved
        a resolution asserting a separate identity from China and called for the enactment
        of a new constitution for a \"normal country\". It also called for general
        use of \"Taiwan\" as the country''s name, without abolishing its formal name,
        the Republic of China. The Chen administration also pushed for referendums
        on national defence and UN entry in the 2004 and 2008 elections, which failed
        due to voter turnout below the required legal threshold of 50% of all registered
        voters. The Chen administration was dogged by public concerns over reduced
        economic growth, legislative gridlock due to a pan-blue, opposition-controlled
        Legislative Yuan and corruption involving the First Family as well as government
        officials.</p>\n<p>The KMT increased its majority in the Legislative Yuan
        in the January 2008 legislative elections, while its nominee Ma Ying-jeou
        went on to win the presidency in March of the same year, campaigning on a
        platform of increased economic growth and better ties with the PRC under a
        policy of \"mutual nondenial\". Ma took office on 20 May 2008, the same day
        that President Chen Shui-bian stepped down and was notified by prosecutors
        of possible corruption charges. Part of the rationale for campaigning for
        closer economic ties with the PRC stems from the strong economic growth China
        attained since joining the World Trade Organization. However, some analysts
        say that despite the election of Ma Ying-jeou, the diplomatic and military
        tensions with the PRC have not been reduced.</p>\n<p>On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional
        Court ruled that current marriage laws are unconstitutional and that same-sex
        couples in the Taiwanese LGBT community should have the right to marry. The
        court has given the Legislative Yuan two years to adequately amend Taiwanese
        marriage laws. According to the court ruling, if amendments are not passed
        within two years, same-sex marriages will automatically become legal in Taiwan.</p>\n<h2><span

        making it the world''s 137th-largest country/dependency, smaller than Switzerland
        and larger than Belgium.</p>\n<p>The island of Taiwan has an area of 35,883\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>
        (13,855\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and lies some 180 kilometres (110\u00a0mi) from
        the southeastern coast of mainland China across the Taiwan Strait. The East
        China Sea lies to the north, the Philippine Sea to the east, the Bashi Channel
        of the Luzon Strait directly to the south, and the South China Sea to the
        southwest. Its shape is similar to a sweet potato, giving rise to the name
        <i>sweet potato</i> used by Taiwanese Hokkien speakers for people of Taiwanese
        descent.</p>\n<p>The island is characterized by the contrast between the eastern
        two-thirds, consisting mostly of rugged mountains running in five ranges from
        the northern to the southern tip of the island, and the flat to gently rolling
        Chianan Plains in the west that are also home to most of Taiwan''s population.
        Taiwan''s highest point is Yu Shan (Jade Mountain) at 3,952 metres (12,966\u00a0ft),
        making Taiwan the world''s fourth-highest island.</p>\n<p>The Penghu Islands,
        50\u00a0km (31.1\u00a0mi) west of the main island, have an area of 126.9\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>
        (49.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). More distant islands controlled by the Republic of
        China are the Kinmen, Wuchiu and Matsu Islands off the coast of Fujian, with
        a total area of 180.5\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (69.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and the

        of 2.9\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (1.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and no permanent inhabitants.
        The ROC government also claims the Senkaku Islands to the northeast, which
        are controlled by Japan.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Climate\">Climate</span></h3>\n<p>Taiwan
        lies on the Tropic of Cancer, and its general climate is marine tropical.
        The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical
        and the mountainous regions are temperate. The average rainfall is 2,600 millimetres
        (100 inches) per year for the island proper; the rainy season is concurrent
        with the onset of the summer East Asian Monsoon in May and June. The entire
        island experiences hot, humid weather from June through September. Typhoons
        are most common in July, August and September. During the winter (November
        to March), the northeast experiences steady rain, while the central and southern
        parts of the island are mostly sunny.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Geology\">Geology</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        island of Taiwan lies in a complex tectonic area between the Yangtze Plate
        to the west and north, the Okinawa Plate on the north-east, and the Philippine
        Mobile Belt on the east and south. The upper part of the crust on the island
        is primarily made up of a series of terranes, mostly old island arcs which
        have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the Eurasian
        Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. These have been further uplifted as a
        result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was subducted
        beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust
        under Taiwan more buoyant.</p>\n<p>The east and south of Taiwan are a complex
        system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between
        the North Luzon Trough portion of the Luzon Volcanic Arc and South China,
        where accreted portions of the Luzon Arc and Luzon forearc form the eastern
        Coastal Range and parallel inland Longitudinal Valley of Taiwan respectively.</p>\n<p>The
        major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between
        the various terranes. These have produced major quakes throughout the history
        of the island. On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the \"921 earthquake\"
        killed more than 2,400 people. The seismic hazard map for Taiwan by the USGS
        shows 9/10 of the island as the highest rating (most hazardous).</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Political_and_legal_status\">Political and legal status</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The
        political and legal statuses of Taiwan are contentious issues. The People''s
        Republic of China (PRC) claims that the Republic of China government is illegitimate,
        referring to it as the \"Taiwan Authority\" even though current ROC territories
        have never been controlled by the PRC. The ROC has its own constitution, independently
        elected president and armed forces. It has not formally renounced its claim
        to the mainland, but ROC government publications have increasingly downplayed
        it.</p>\n<p>Internationally, there is controversy on whether the ROC still
        exists as a state or a defunct state per international law due to the lack
        of wide diplomatic recognition. In a poll of Taiwanese aged 20 and older taken
        by TVBS in March 2009, a majority of 64% opted for the \"status quo\", while
        19% favoured \"independence\" and 5% favoured \"unification\".</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Relations_with_the_PRC\">Relations with the PRC</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        political environment is complicated by the potential for military conflict
        should Taiwan declare de jure independence; it is the official PRC policy
        to use force to ensure unification if peaceful unification is no longer possible,
        as stated in its anti-secession law, and for this reason there are substantial
        military installations on the Fujian coast.</p>\n<p>On 29 April 2005, Kuomintang
        Chairman Lien Chan travelled to Beijing and met with Communist Party of China
        (CPC) Secretary-General Hu Jintao, the first meeting between the leaders of
        the two parties since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. On 11 February
        2014, Mainland Affairs Council Head Wang Yu-chi travelled to Nanjing and met
        with Taiwan Affairs Office Head Zhang Zhijun, the first meeting between high-ranking
        officials from either side. Zhang paid a reciprocal visit to Taiwan and met
        Wang on 25 June 2014, making Zhang the first minister-level PRC official to
        ever visit Taiwan. On 7 November 2015, Ma Ying-jeou (in his capacity as <i>Leader
        of Taiwan</i>) and Xi Jinping (in his capacity as <i>Leader of Mainland China</i>)
        travelled to Singapore and met up, marking the highest-level exchange between
        the two sides since 1949.</p>\n<p>The PRC supports a version of the One-China
        policy, which states that Taiwan and mainland China are both part of China,
        and that the PRC is the only legitimate government of China. It uses this
        policy to prevent the international recognition of the ROC as an independent
        sovereign state, meaning that Taiwan participates in international forums
        under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". With the emergence of the Taiwanese independence
        movement, the name \"Taiwan\" has been employed increasingly often on the
        island.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Foreign_relations\">Foreign relations</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before
        1928, the foreign policy of Republican China was complicated by a lack of
        internal unity\u2014competing centres of power all claimed legitimacy. This
        situation changed after the defeat of the Peiyang Government by the Kuomintang,
        which led to widespread diplomatic recognition of the Republic of China.</p>\n<p>After
        the KMT''s retreat to Taiwan, most countries, notably the countries in the
        Western Bloc, continued to maintain relations with the ROC. Due to diplomatic
        pressure, recognition gradually eroded and many countries switched recognition
        to the PRC in the 1970s. UN Resolution 2758 (25 October 1971) recognized the
        People''s Republic of China as China''s sole representative in the United
        Nations.</p>\n<p>The PRC refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation
        that recognizes the ROC, and requires all nations with which it has diplomatic
        relations to make a statement recognizing its claims to Taiwan. As a result,
        only 19\u00a0UN member states and the Holy See maintain official diplomatic
        relations with the Republic of China. The ROC maintains unofficial relations
        with most countries via <i>de facto</i> embassies and consulates called Taipei
        Economic and Cultural Representative Offices (TECRO), with branch offices
        called \"Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices\" (TECO). Both TECRO and TECO
        are \"unofficial commercial entities\" of the ROC in charge of maintaining
        diplomatic relations, providing consular services (i.e. visa applications),
        and serving the national interests of the ROC in other countries.</p>\n<p>The
        United States remains one of the main allies of the country and, through the
        Taiwan Relations Act passed in 1979, has continued selling arms and providing
        military training to the Armed Forces. This situation continues to be an issue
        for the People''s Republic of China which considers US involvement disruptive
        to the stability of the region. In January 2010, the Obama administration
        announced its intention to sell $6.4 billion worth of military hardware to
        Taiwan. As a consequence, the PRC threatened the US with economic sanctions
        and warned that their co-operation on international and regional issues could
        suffer.</p>\n<p>The official position of the United States is that the PRC
        is expected to \"use no force or threat[en] to use force against Taiwan\"
        and the ROC is to \"exercise prudence in managing all aspects of Cross-Strait
        relations.\" Both are to refrain from performing actions or espousing statements
        \"that would unilaterally alter Taiwan''s status.\"</p>\n<p>On 16 December
        2015, the Obama administration announced a deal to sell $1.83 billion worth
        of arms to the armed forces of the ROC. China''s foreign ministry had expressed
        its disapproval for the sales and issued the US a \"stern warning\", saying
        it would hurt China\u2013US relations.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Participation_in_international_events_and_organizations\">Participation
        in international events and organizations</span></h3>\n\n<p>The ROC was a
        founding member of the United Nations, and held the seat of China on the Security
        Council and other UN bodies until 1971, when it was expelled by Resolution
        2758 and replaced in all UN organs with the PRC. Each year since 1992, the
        ROC has petitioned the UN for entry, but its applications have not made it
        past committee.</p>\n\n<p>Due to its limited international recognition, the
        Republic of China is a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization,
        represented by a government-funded organization, the Taiwan Foundation for
        Democracy (TFD) under the name \"Taiwan\".</p>\n<p>Also due to its One China
        policy, the PRC only participates in international organizations where the
        ROC is not recognized as a sovereign country. Most member states, including
        the United States, do not wish to discuss the issue of the ROC''s political
        status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the PRC. However, both the
        US and Japan publicly support the ROC''s bid for membership in the World Health
        Organization as an observer. However, though the ROC sought to participate
        in the WHO since 1997, their efforts were blocked by the PRC until 2010, when
        they were invited as observers to attend the World Health Assembly, under
        the name \"Chinese Taipei\".</p>\n<p>Due to PRC pressure, the ROC is forced
        to use the name \"Chinese Taipei\" in international events, such as the Olympic
        Games, where the PRC is also a party. The ROC is typically barred from using
        its national anthem and national flag in international events due to PRC pressure;
        ROC spectators attending events such as the Olympics are often barred from
        bringing ROC flags into venues. Taiwan also participates in the Asia-Pacific
        Economic Cooperation forum (since 1991) and the World Trade Organization (since
        2002) under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". The ROC is able to participate as
        \"China\" in organizations that the PRC does not participate in, such as the
        World Organization of the Scout Movement.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Opinions_within_Taiwan\">Opinions
        within Taiwan</span></h3>\n\n<p>Within Taiwan, opinions are polarized between
        those supporting unification, represented by the Pan-Blue Coalition of parties,
        and those supporting independence, represented by the Pan-Green Coalition.</p>\n<p>The
        KMT, the largest Pan-Blue party, supports the status quo for the indefinite
        future with a stated ultimate goal of unification. However, it does not support
        unification in the short term with the PRC as such a prospect would be unacceptable
        to most of its members and the public. Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the KMT and
        former president of the ROC, has set out democracy, economic development to
        a level near that of Taiwan, and equitable wealth distribution as the conditions
        that the PRC must fulfill for reunification to occur.</p>\n<p>The Democratic
        Progressive Party, the largest Pan-Green party, officially seeks independence,
        but in practice also supports the status quo because its members and the public
        would not accept the risk of provoking the PRC.</p>\n<p>On 2 September 2008,
        Mexican newspaper <i>El Sol de M\u00e9xico</i> asked President Ma about his
        views on the subject of \"two Chinas\" and if there was a solution for the
        sovereignty issues between the two. The president replied that the relations
        are neither between two Chinas nor two states. It is a special relationship.
        Further, he stated that the sovereignty issues between the two cannot be resolved
        at present, but he quoted the \"1992 Consensus\", currently accepted by both
        the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China, as a temporary measure until
        a solution becomes available.</p>\n<p>On 27 September 2017, Taiwanese premier
        William Lai said that he was a \u201cpolitical worker who advocates Taiwan
        independence\u201d, but that as Taiwan was an independent country called the
        Republic of China, it had no need to declare independence. The relationship
        with the PRC and the related issues of Taiwanese independence and Chinese
        unification continue to dominate politics.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Government_and_politics\">Government
        and politics</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The government of the Republic of China
        was founded on the Constitution of the ROC and its Three Principles of the
        People, which states that the ROC \"shall be a democratic republic of the
        people, to be governed by the people and for the people.\" The government
        is divided into five branches (<i>Yuan</i>): the Executive Yuan (cabinet),
        the Legislative Yuan (Congress or Parliament), the Judicial Yuan, the Control
        Yuan (audit agency), and the Examination Yuan (civil service examination agency).
        The constitution was drafted before the fall of mainland China to the Communist
        Party of China. It was created by the KMT for the purpose of all of its claimed
        territory, including Taiwan, even though the Communist Party boycotted the
        drafting of the constitution. The constitution went into effect on 25 December
        1947. The ROC remained under martial law from 1948 until 1987 and much of
        the constitution was not in effect. Political reforms beginning in the late
        1970s and continuing through the early 1990s liberalized the country and transformed
        into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic
        of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components
        that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment
        continues. In 2000, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidency,
        ending KMT''s continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National
        Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement
        several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National
        Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of
        constitutional reform to the popular ballot.</p>\n<p>The head of state and
        commander-in-chief of the armed forces is the president, who is elected by
        popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the
        vice-president. The president has authority over the Yuan. The president appoints
        the members of the Executive Yuan as his cabinet, including a premier, who
        is officially the President of the Executive Yuan; members are responsible
        for policy and administration.</p>\n<p>The main legislative body is the unicameral
        Legislative Yuan with 113 seats. Seventy-three are elected by popular vote
        from single-member constituencies; thirty-four are elected based on the proportion
        of nationwide votes received by participating political parties in a separate
        party list ballot; and six are elected from two three-member aboriginal constituencies.
        Members serve four-year terms. Originally the unicameral National Assembly,
        as a standing constitutional convention and electoral college, held some parliamentary
        functions, but the National Assembly was abolished in 2005 with the power
        of constitutional amendments handed over to the Legislative Yuan and all eligible
        voters of the Republic via referendums.</p>\n<p>The premier is selected by
        the president without the need for approval from the legislature, but the
        legislature can pass laws without regard for the president, as neither he
        nor the Premier wields veto power. Thus, there is little incentive for the
        president and the legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing
        parties. After the election of the pan-Green''s Chen Shui-bian as President
        in 2000, legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the Legislative
        Yuan, which was controlled by a pan-Blue majority. Historically, the ROC has
        been dominated by strongman single party politics. This legacy has resulted
        in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the president
        rather than the premier, even though the constitution does not explicitly
        state the extent of the president''s executive power.</p>\n<p>The Judicial
        Yuan is the highest judicial organ. It interprets the constitution and other
        laws and decrees, judges administrative suits, and disciplines public functionaries.
        The president and vice-president of the Judicial Yuan and additional thirteen
        justices form the Council of Grand Justices. They are nominated and appointed
        by the president, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The highest court,
        the Supreme Court, consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each
        of which is formed by a presiding judge and four associate judges, all appointed
        for life. In 1993, a separate constitutional court was established to resolve
        constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and
        accelerate the democratization process. There is no trial by jury but the
        right to a fair public trial is protected by law and respected in practice;
        many cases are presided over by multiple judges.</p>\n\n<p>Capital punishment
        is still used in Taiwan, although efforts have been made by the government
        to reduce the number of executions. Nevertheless, according to a survey in
        2006, about 80% of Taiwanese still wanted to keep the death penalty.</p>\n<p>The
        Control Yuan is a watchdog agency that monitors (controls) the actions of
        the executive. It can be considered a standing commission for administrative
        inquiry and can be compared to the Court of Auditors of the European Union
        or the Government Accountability Office of the United States.</p>\n<p>The
        Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants.
        It is based on the old imperial examination system used in dynastic China.
        It can be compared to the European Personnel Selection Office of the European
        Union or the Office of Personnel Management of the United States.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Major_camps\">Major camps</span></h3>\n\n<p>The tension between China
        and Taiwan colours most of the political life, and any government move towards
        \"Taiwan independence\" is met by threat of military attack from the PRC.
        The PRC''s official policy is to reunify Taiwan and mainland China under the
        formula of \"one country, two systems\" and refuses to renounce the use of
        military force, especially should Taiwan seek a declaration of independence.</p>\n<p>The
        political scene is generally divided into two major camps in terms of views
        on how Taiwan should relate to China or the PRC, referred to as cross-Strait
        relations. It is the main political difference between two camps: the Pan-Blue
        Coalition, composed of the pro-unification Kuomintang, People First Party
        (PFP), and New Party, who believe that the ROC is the sole legitimate government
        of \"China\" (including Taiwan) and supports eventual Chinese reunification.
        The opposition Pan-Green Coalition is composed of the pro-independence DPP
        and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU). It regards Taiwan as an independent, sovereign
        state synonymous with the ROC, opposes the definition that Taiwan is part
        of \"China\", and seeks wide diplomatic recognition and an eventual declaration
        of formal Taiwan independence. The Pan-Green camp tends to favour emphasizing
        the Republic of China as being a distinct country from the People''s Republic
        of China. Thus, in September 2007, the then ruling Democratic Progressive
        Party approved a resolution asserting separate identity from China and called
        for the enactment of a new constitution for a \"<i>normal country</i>\". It
        called also for general use of \"<i>Taiwan</i>\" as the country''s name, without
        abolishing its formal name, the \"Republic of China\". Some members of the
        coalition, such as former President Chen Shui-bian, argue that it is unnecessary
        to proclaim independence because \"Taiwan is already an independent, sovereign
        country\" and the Republic of China is the same as Taiwan. Despite being a
        member of KMT prior to and during his presidency, Lee Teng-hui also held a
        similar view and was a supporter of the Taiwanization movement.</p>\n<p>Pan-Blue
        members generally support the concept of the One-China policy, which states
        that there is only one China and that its only government is the ROC. They
        favour eventual re-unification of China. The more mainstream Pan-Blue position
        is to lift investment restrictions and pursue negotiations with the PRC to
        immediately open direct transportation links. Regarding independence, the
        mainstream Pan-Blue position is to maintain the status quo, while refusing
        immediate reunification. President Ma Ying-jeou stated that there will be
        no unification nor declaration of independence during his presidency. As of
        2009, Pan-Blue members usually seek to improve relationships with mainland
        China, with a current focus on improving economic ties.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Current_political_issues\">Current
        political issues</span></h3>\n<p>The dominant political issue in Taiwan is
        its relationship with the PRC. For almost 60\u00a0years, there were no direct
        transportation links, including direct flights, between Taiwan and mainland
        China. This was a problem for many Taiwanese businesses that had opened factories
        or branches in mainland China. The former DPP administration feared that such
        links would lead to tighter economic and political integration with mainland
        China, and in the 2006 Lunar New Year Speech, President Chen Shui-bian called
        for managed opening of links. Direct weekend charter flights between Taiwan
        and mainland China began in July 2008 under the current KMT government, and
        the first direct daily charter flights took off in December 2008.</p>\n<p>Other
        major political issues include the passage of an arms procurement bill that
        the United States authorized in 2001. In 2008, however, the United States
        was reluctant to send over more arms to Taiwan out of fear that it would hinder
        the recent improvement of ties between the PRC and the ROC. Another major
        political issue is the establishment of a National Communications Commission
        to take over from the Government Information Office, whose advertising budget
        exercised great control over the media.</p>\n<p>The politicians and their
        parties have themselves become major political issues. Corruption among some
        DPP administration officials has been exposed. In early 2006, President Chen
        Shui-bian was linked to possible corruption. The political effect on President
        Chen Shui-bian was great, causing a divide in the DPP leadership and supporters
        alike. It eventually led to the creation of a political camp led by ex-DPP
        leader Shih Ming-teh which believes the president should resign. The KMT assets
        continue to be another major issue, as it was once the richest political party
        in the world. Nearing the end of 2006, KMT''s chairman Ma Ying-jeou was also
        hit by corruption controversies, although he has since then been cleared of
        any wrongdoings by the courts. After completing his second term as President,
        Chen Shui-bian was charged with corruption and money laundering. Following
        his conviction, he is serving a 17-year sentence in Taipei Prison.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"National_identity\">National identity</span></h3>\n\n<p>Roughly 84% of
        Taiwan''s population descends from Han Chinese who migrated from Qing China
        between 1661 and 1895. Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese
        who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The
        shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical
        separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences,
        as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national
        identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratization
        and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed
        to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart
        of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland
        China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for
        <i>de jure</i> Taiwan independence. The pan-green camp supports a distinct
        Taiwanese identity, while the pan-blue camp supports a Chinese identity only.
        The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a
        Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.</p>\n<p>According to a survey
        conducted in March 2009, 49% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese
        only, and 44% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese and Chinese.
        3% consider themselves as only Chinese. Another survey, conducted in Taiwan
        in July 2009, showed that 82.8% of respondents consider the ROC and the PRC
        as two separate countries with each developing on its own. A survey conducted
        in December 2009 showed that 62% of the respondents consider themselves as
        Taiwanese only, and 22% of the respondents consider themselves as both Taiwanese
        and Chinese. 8% consider themselves as only Chinese. The survey also shows
        that among 18- to 29-year-old respondents, 75% consider themselves as Taiwanese
        only.</p>\n<p>In the latest survey conducted by National Chengchi University
        in 2014 and published in early 2015, 60.6% of respondents identified themselves
        exclusively as Taiwanese, 32.5% identified themselves as both Taiwanese and
        Chinese and 3.5% identified themselves as Chinese.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Military\">Military</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The
        Republic of China Army takes its roots in the National Revolutionary Army,
        which was established by Sun Yat-sen in 1925 in Guangdong with a goal of reunifying
        China under the Kuomintang. When the People''s Liberation Army won the Chinese
        Civil War, much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along
        with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army.
        Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded
        or incorporated into the People''s Liberation Army.</p>\n<p>Today, the Republic
        of China maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as
        defence against the constant threat of invasion by the PRC under the Anti-Secession
        Law of the People''s Republic of China. From 1949 to the 1970s, the primary
        mission of the military was to \"retake the mainland\" through Project National
        Glory. As this mission has shifted to defence, the ROC military has begun
        to shift emphasis from the traditionally dominant Army to the air force and
        navy.</p>\n<p>Control of the armed forces has also passed into the hands of
        the civilian government. As the ROC military shares historical roots with
        the KMT, the older generation of high-ranking officers tends to have Pan-Blue
        sympathies. However, many have retired and there are many more non-mainlanders
        enlisting in the armed forces in the younger generations, so the political
        leanings of the military have moved closer to the public norm in Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The
        ROC began a force reduction program, Jingshi An (translated to streamlining
        program), to scale down its military from a level of 450,000 in 1997 to 380,000
        in 2001. As of 2009, the armed forces of the ROC number approximately 300,000,
        with nominal reserves totalling 3.6\u00a0million as of 2005. Conscription
        remains universal for qualified males reaching age eighteen, but as a part
        of the reduction effort many are given the opportunity to fulfill their draft
        requirement through alternative service and are redirected to government agencies
        or defence related industries. Current plans call for a transition to a predominantly
        professional army over the next decade. Conscription periods are planned to
        decrease from 14\u00a0months to 12. In the last months of the Bush administration,
        Taipei took the decision to reverse the trend of declining defence spending,
        at a time when most Asian countries kept on reducing their military expenditures.
        It also decided to modernize both defensive and offensive capabilities. Taipei
        still keeps a large military apparatus relative to the island''s population:
        defence expenditures for 2008 were NTD 334 billion (approximately US $10.5
        billion), which accounted for 2.94% of GDP.</p>\n\n\n<p>The armed forces''
        primary concern at this time, according to the <i>National Defense Report</i>,
        is the possibility of an invasion by the PRC, consisting of a naval blockade,
        airborne assault, and/or missile bombardment. Four upgraded <i>Kidd</i>-class
        destroyers were purchased from the United States, and commissioned into the
        Republic of China Navy in 2005\u20132006, significantly upgrading Taiwan''s
        air defence and submarine hunting abilities. The Ministry of National Defense
        planned to purchase diesel-powered submarines and Patriot anti-missile batteries
        from the United States, but its budget has been stalled repeatedly by the
        opposition-Pan-Blue Coalition controlled legislature. The defence package
        was stalled from 2001 to 2007 where it was finally passed through the legislature
        and the US responded on 3 October 2008, with a $6.5\u00a0billion arms package
        including PAC III Anti-Air defence systems, AH-64D Apache Attack helicopters
        and other arms and parts. A significant amount of military hardware has been
        bought from the United States, and, as of 2009, continues to be legally guaranteed
        by the Taiwan Relations Act. In the past, France and the Netherlands have
        also sold military weapons and hardware to the ROC, but they almost entirely
        stopped in the 1990s under pressure of the PRC.</p>\n<p>The first line of
        defence against invasion by the PRC is the ROC''s own armed forces. Current
        ROC military doctrine is to hold out against an invasion or blockade until
        the US military responds. There is, however, no guarantee in the Taiwan Relations
        Act or any other treaty that the United States will defend Taiwan, even in
        the event of invasion. The joint declaration on security between the US and
        Japan signed in 1996 may imply that Japan would be involved in any response.
        However, Japan has refused to stipulate whether the \"area surrounding Japan\"
        mentioned in the pact includes Taiwan, and the precise purpose of the pact
        is unclear. The Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS
        Treaty) may mean that other US allies, such as Australia, could theoretically
        be involved. In practice, the risk of losing economic ties with China may
        prevent Australia from taking action. The United States, United Kingdom, Japan,
        South Korea, Australia, Canada, Chile, and Peru conduct maritime exercises
        in the Pacific Ocean every two years called RIMPAC. They are conducted to
        promote stability and to be able to respond in case of an armed conflict in
        the region \u2013 that includes an invasion of Taiwan by China.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Administrative_divisions\">Administrative divisions</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According
        to the 1947 constitution, the territory of the ROC is according to its \"existing
        national boundaries\". According to the Executive Yuan in 2012, Mongolia was
        re-recognized by Republic of China as an independent country when the constitution
        was announced in 1946.</p>\n<p>When the ROC retreated to Taiwan in 1949, its
        claimed territory consisted of 35 provinces, 12 special municipalities, 1
        special administrative region and 2 autonomous regions. However, since its
        retreat, the ROC has controlled only Taiwan Province and some islands of Fujian
        Province. The ROC also controls the Pratas Islands and Taiping Island in the
        Spratly Islands, which are part of the disputed South China Sea Islands. They
        were placed under Kaohsiung administration after the retreat to Taiwan.</p>\n<p>Since
        1949, the government has made some changes in the area under its control.
        Taipei became a special municipality in 1967 and Kaohsiung in 1979. The two
        provincial governments were \"streamlined\", with their functions transferred
        to the central government (Fujian in 1956 and Taiwan in 1998). In 2010, New
        Taipei, Taichung and Tainan were upgraded to special municipalities. And in
        2014, Taoyuan County was also upgraded to Taoyuan special municipality. This
        brought the top-level divisions to their current state:</p>\n<p>According
        to Article 4 of the Local Government Act, laws pertaining to special municipalities
        also apply to counties with a population exceeding 2 million. This provision
        does not currently apply to any county, although it previously applied to
        Taipei County (now New Taipei City) and Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City).</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Economy_and_industry\">Economy and industry</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The quick
        industrialization and rapid growth of Taiwan during the latter half of the
        20th century has been called the \"Taiwan Miracle\". Taiwan is one of the
        \"Four Asian Tigers\" alongside Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.</p>\n<p>Japanese
        rule prior to and during World War II brought changes in the public and private
        sectors, most notably in the area of public works, which enabled rapid communications
        and facilitated transport throughout much of the island. The Japanese also
        improved public education and made it compulsory for all residents of Taiwan.</p>\n<p>By
        1945, hyperinflation was in progress in mainland China and Taiwan as a result
        of the war with Japan. To isolate Taiwan from it, the Nationalist government
        created a new currency area for the island, and began a price stabilization
        program. These efforts significantly slowed inflation.</p>\n<p>When the KMT
        government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of taels (where 1\u00a0tael
        ~1.2\u00a0ozt) of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China,
        which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.
        Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought
        the intellectual and business elites from Mainland China. The KMT government
        instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted
        on mainland China. The government also implemented a policy of import-substitution,
        attempting to produce imported goods domestically.</p>\n<p>In 1950, with the
        outbreak of the Korean War, the United States began an aid program which resulted
        in fully stabilized prices by 1952. Economic development was encouraged by
        American economic aid and programs such as the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction,
        which turned the agricultural sector into the basis for later growth. Under
        the combined stimulus of the land reform and the agricultural development
        programs, agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 4
        per cent from 1952 to 1959, which was greater than the population growth,
        3.6%.</p>\n<p>In 1962, Taiwan had a (nominal) per-capita gross national product
        (GNP) of $170, placing its economy on a par with those of the Democratic Republic
        of the Congo. On a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, its GDP per capita
        in the early 1960s was $1,353 (in 1990 prices). By 2011 per-capita GNP, adjusted
        for purchasing power parity (PPP), had risen to $37,000, contributing to a
        Human Development Index (HDI) equivalent to that of other developed countries.
        Taiwan''s HDI in 2012 is 0.890, (23rd, very high), according to the UN''s
        new \"Inequality-adjusted HDI\" calculation method.</p>\n<p>In 1974, Chiang
        Ching-kuo implemented the Ten Major Construction Projects, the beginning foundations
        that helped Taiwan transform into its current export driven economy. Since
        the 1990s, a number of Taiwan-based technology firms have expanded their reach
        around the world. Well-known international technology companies headquartered
        in Taiwan include personal computer manufacturers Acer Inc. and Asus, mobile
        phone maker HTC, as well as electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn, which
        makes products for Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Computex Taipei is a major
        computer expo, held since 1981.</p>\n\n<p>Today Taiwan has a dynamic, capitalist,
        export-driven economy with gradually decreasing state involvement in investment
        and foreign trade. In keeping with this trend, some large government-owned
        banks and industrial firms are being privatized. Real growth in GDP has averaged
        about 8% during the past three decades. Exports have provided the primary
        impetus for industrialization. The trade surplus is substantial, and foreign
        reserves are the world''s fifth largest. The Republic of China has its own
        currency, the New Taiwan dollar.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the 1990s,
        the economic ties between Taiwan and the People''s Republic of China have
        been very prolific. As of 2008, more than US$150 billion have been invested
        in the PRC by Taiwanese companies, and about 10% of the Taiwanese labour force
        works in the PRC, often to run their own businesses. Although the economy
        of Taiwan benefits from this situation, some have expressed the view that
        the island has become increasingly dependent on the Mainland Chinese economy.
        A 2008 white paper by the Department of Industrial Technology states that
        \"Taiwan should seek to maintain stable relation with China while continuing
        to protect national security, and avoiding excessive ''Sinicization'' of Taiwanese
        economy.\" Others argue that close economic ties between Taiwan and Mainland
        China would make any military intervention by the PLA against Taiwan very
        costly, and therefore less probable.</p>\n<p>Taiwan''s total trade in 2010
        reached an all-time high of US$526.04 billion, according to Taiwan''s Ministry
        of Finance. Both exports and imports for the year reached record levels, totalling
        US$274.64 billion and US$251.4 billion, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, agriculture
        constituted only 2% of GDP, down from 35% in 1952. Traditional labour-intensive
        industries are steadily being moved offshore and with more capital and technology-intensive
        industries replacing them. High-technology industrial parks have sprung up
        in every region in Taiwan. The ROC has become a major foreign investor in
        the PRC, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. It is
        estimated that some 50,000\u00a0Taiwanese businesses and 1,000,000\u00a0businesspeople
        and their dependents are established in the PRC.</p>\n<p>Because of its conservative
        financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little
        compared with many of its neighbours from the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
        Unlike its neighbours, South Korea and Japan, the Taiwanese economy is dominated
        by small and medium-sized businesses, rather than the large business groups.
        The global economic downturn, however, combined with poor policy co-ordination
        by the new administration and increasing bad debts in the banking system,
        pushed Taiwan into recession in 2001, the first whole year of negative growth
        since 1947. Due to the relocation of many manufacturing and labour-intensive
        industries to the PRC, unemployment also reached a level not seen since the
        1970s oil crisis. This became a major issue in the 2004 presidential election.
        Growth averaged more than 4% in the 2002\u20132006 period and the unemployment
        rate fell below 4%.</p>\n<p>The ROC often joins international organizations
        (especially ones that also include the People''s Republic of China) under
        a politically neutral name. The ROC has been a member of governmental trade
        organizations such as the World Trade Organization under the name Separate
        Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei) since
        2002.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Transportation\">Transportation</span></h2>\n\n<p>The
        Ministry of Transportation and Communications of the Republic of China is
        the cabinet-level governing body of the transportation network in Taiwan.
        Taiwan has an extensive highway network, classified into five levels: national
        highways, provincial highways, county routes, township routes, and special
        routes, with the first four being common. Taiwan also has an extensive bus
        network, most of which are run by private bus companies. Inter-city rail services
        are provided by Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) and Taiwan High Speed
        Rail (THSR). Rapid transit systems include the Taipei Metro, Taoyuan Metro
        (incl. the Airport MRT) and Kaohsiung MRT, while Taichung Metro is under construction.
        Major airports include Taiwan Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, Taipei Songshan and Taichung.
        There are currently seven airlines in Taiwan, the largest ones being China
        Airlines and EVA Air. There are four international seaports: Keelung, Kaohsiung,
        Taichung, and Hualien.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Education,_research,_and_academia\"></span><span
        id=\"Education.2C_research.2C_and_academia\">Education, research, and academia</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The
        higher education system was established in Taiwan by Japan during the colonial
        period. However, after the Republic of China took over Taiwan from Japan in
        1945, the system was promptly replaced by the same system as in mainland China
        which mixed with features of the Chinese and American educational systems.</p>\n<p>Taiwan
        is well known for adhering to the Confucian paradigm of valuing education
        as a means to improve one''s socioeconomic position in Taiwanese society.
        Heavy investment and a cultural value for education has catapulted the resource
        poor nation consistently atop the global education rankings. Taiwan is one
        of the top-performing countries in reading literacy, maths and sciences. In
        2015, Taiwanese students achieved one of the world''s best results in mathematics,
        science and literacy, as tested by the Programme for International Student
        Assessment (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils'' scholastic
        performance. The strong scholastic and educational performance of Taiwanese
        students has prompted the nation to build a highly educated labour force that
        possesses a strong background in mathematics and science to cope with the
        current labor market demands of the 21st century.</p>\n<p>The Taiwanese education
        system has been praised for various reasons including its comparatively high
        test results and its major role in ushering Taiwan''s economic development
        while creating one of the world\u2019s most highly educated workforces. The
        country has also been praised for its high university entrance rate where
        the university acceptance rate has increased from around 20 percent before
        the 1970s to 49 percent in 1996 and over 90 percent since 2006, among the
        highest in Asia. The nation''s high university entrance rate has created a
        highly skilled workforce making Taiwan one of the most highly educated countries
        in the world with 68.5% of Taiwanese high school students going on to attend
        university. Taiwan has a high percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary
        education degree where 45 percent of Taiwanese aged 25\u201364 hold a bachelors
        degree or higher compared with the average of 33 percent among member countries
        of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). On the
        other hand, the system has been criticized for placing excessive pressure
        on students and eschewing creativity in favor of rote memorization. In addition,
        the system has been criticized for producing an excess supply of over-educated
        university graduates and a higher unemployment rate. With a large supply of
        university graduates seeking a limited demand of prestigious white collar
        jobs in an environment that is increasingly losing its competitive edge has
        led many degree holders ending up with lower end jobs with salaries far beneath
        than their expectations. Taiwan\u2019s universities have also been under criticism
        for not being able to fully meet the requirements and demands of Taiwan\u2019s
        21st century fast-moving job market citing a skills mismatch among a large
        number of self-assessed overeducated university graduates that don''t fit
        the demands of the modern Taiwanese labor market. The Taiwanese government
        has also been criticized for undermining the economy as it has been unable
        to produce enough jobs to meet the demands of numerous underemployed university
        graduates.</p>\n<p>As the Taiwanese economy is largely science and technology
        based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher
        education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain
        a competitive edge when searching for employment. Although current Taiwanese
        law mandates only nine years of schooling, 95% of junior high graduates go
        on to attend a senior vocational high school, university, junior college,
        trade school, or other higher education institution.</p>\n<p>Many Taiwanese
        students attend cram schools, or bushiban, to improve skills and knowledge
        on problem solving against exams of subjects like mathematics, nature science,
        history and many others. Courses are available for most popular subjects.
        Lessons are organized in lectures, reviews, private tutorial sessions, and
        recitations.</p>\n<p>As of 2013, the literacy rate in Taiwan is 97.15%.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Demographics\">Demographics</span></h2>\n\n<p>Taiwan''s population is
        about 23.4 million, most of whom are on the island proper. The remainder live
        on Penghu (101,758), Kinmen (127,723), and Matsu (12,506).</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Ethnic_groups\">Ethnic groups</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The ROC government
        reports that over 95% of the population is Han, of which the majority includes
        descendants of early Han Chinese immigrants who arrived in Taiwan in large
        numbers starting in the 18th century. Alternatively, the ethnic groups of
        Taiwan may be roughly divided among the Hoklo (70%), the Hakka (14%), the
        Waishengren (14%), and indigenous peoples (2%).</p>\n<p>The Hoklo people are
        the largest Han subgroup (70% of the total population), whose ancestors migrated
        from the coastal southern Fujian region across the Taiwan Strait starting
        in the 17th century. The Hakka comprise about 15% of the total population,
        and descend from Han migrants to Guangdong, its surrounding areas and Taiwan.
        Additional people of Han origin include and descend from the 2 million Nationalists
        who fled to Taiwan following the communist victory on the mainland in 1949.</p>\n<p>The
        indigenous Taiwanese aborigines number about 533,600 and are divided into
        16 recognized groups. The Ami, Atayal, Bunun, Kanakanavu, Kavalan, Paiwan,
        Puyuma, Rukai, Saisiyat, Saaroa, Sakizaya, Sediq, Thao, Truku and Tsou live
        mostly in the eastern half of the island, while the Yami inhabit Orchid Island.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Languages\">Languages</span></h3>\n\n<p>Mandarin is the official national
        language and is spoken by the vast majority of the population of Taiwan. It
        has been the primary language of instruction in schools since the end of Japanese
        rule. As in Hong Kong and Macau, Traditional Chinese is used as the writing
        system in Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The 70% of the population belonging to the Hoklo
        ethnic group speak Taiwanese Hokkien (a variant of the Min Nan speech of Fujian
        province) as their mother tongue, in addition to Mandarin, and many others
        have some degree of understanding. The Hakka ethnic group (15% of the population)
        use Hakka Chinese. Most <i>waishengren</i> speak primarily Mandarin. Although
        Mandarin is the language of instruction in schools and dominates television
        and radio, non-Mandarin Chinese varieties have undergone a revival in public
        life in Taiwan, particularly since restrictions on their use were lifted in
        the 1990s.</p>\n<p>Taiwan''s indigenous languages, the Formosan languages,
        do not belong to the Chinese or Sino-Tibetan language family, but rather to
        the Austronesian language family. Their use among Taiwan''s aboriginal minority
        groups has been in decline as usage of Mandarin has risen. Of the 14 extant
        languages, five are considered moribund.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Religion\">Religion</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        Constitution of the Republic of China protects people''s freedom of religion
        and the practices of belief. There are approximately 18,718,600 religious
        followers in Taiwan as of 2005 (81.3% of total population) and 14\u201318%
        are non-religious. According to the 2005 census, of the 26 religions recognized
        by the ROC government, the five largest are: Buddhism (8,086,000 or 35.1%),
        Taoism (7,600,000 or 33%), Yiguandao (810,000 or 3.5%), Protestantism (605,000
        or 2.6%), and Roman Catholicism (298,000 or 1.3%).</p>\n<p>The CIA World Factbook
        reports that over 93% of Taiwanese are adherents of a combination of the polytheistic
        Chinese popular religion, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism; 4.5% are adherents
        of Christianity, which includes Protestants, Catholics, and other, non-denominational,
        Christian groups; and less than 2.5% are adherents of other religions. Taiwanese
        aborigines comprise a notable subgroup among professing Christians: \"...over
        64% identify as Christian... Church buildings are the most obvious markers
        of Aboriginal villages, distinguishing them from Taiwanese or Hakka villages.\"</p>\n<p>Confucianism
        is a philosophy that deals with secular moral ethics, and serves as the foundation
        of both Chinese and Taiwanese culture. The majority of Taiwanese people usually
        combine the secular moral teachings of Confucianism with whatever religions
        they are affiliated with.</p>\n<p>As of 2009, there were 14,993 temples in
        Taiwan, approximately one place of worship per 1,500 residents. 9,202 of those
        temples were dedicated to Taoism. In 2008, Taiwan had 3,262 Churches, an increase
        of 145.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Largest_cities\">Largest cities</span></h3>\n\n<p>The
        figures below are the 2011 estimates for the twenty largest urban populations
        within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering
        the total metropolitan area populations (in such rankings the Taipei-Keelung
        metro area is by far the largest agglomeration).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h2><span
        id=\"Public_health\">Public health</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>Health care in Taiwan
        is managed by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI).</p>\n<p>The
        current program was implemented in 1995, and is considered to be a form of
        social insurance. The government health insurance program maintains compulsory
        insurance for citizens who are employed, impoverished, unemployed, or victims
        of natural disasters with fees that correlate to the individual and/or family
        income; it also maintains protection for non-citizens working in Taiwan. A
        standardized method of calculation applies to all persons and can optionally
        be paid by an employer or by individual contributions.</p>\n<p>BNHI insurance
        coverage requires co-payment at the time of service for most services unless
        it is a preventative health service, for low-income families, veterans, children
        under three years old, or in the case of catastrophic diseases. Low income
        households maintain 100% premium coverage by the BNHI and co-pays are reduced
        for disabled or certain elderly people.</p>\n<p>According to a recently published
        survey, out of 3,360\u00a0patients surveyed at a randomly chosen hospital,
        75.1% of the patients said they are \"very satisfied\" with the hospital service;
        20.5% said they are \"okay\" with the service. Only 4.4% of the patients said
        they are either \"not satisfied\" or \"very not satisfied\" with the service
        or care provided.</p>\n<p>Taiwan has its own Center for Disease Control, and
        during the SARS outbreak in March 2003 there were 347\u00a0confirmed cases.
        During the outbreak the Centers for Disease Control and local governments
        set up monitored stations throughout public transportation, recreational sites
        and other public areas. With full containment in July 2003, there has not
        been a case of SARS since.</p>\n<p>As of 2006, the BNHI Facility Contract
        Distribution facilities total 17,259, including:</p>\n<p>Basic coverage areas
        of the insurance include:</p>\n<p>In 2004, the infant mortality rate was 5.3
        with 15\u00a0physicians and 63\u00a0hospital beds per 10,000\u00a0people.
        The life expectancy for males was 73.5\u00a0years and 79.7\u00a0years for
        females according to the World Health Report.</p>\n<p>In July 2013, the Department
        of Health was restructured as the Ministry of Health and Welfare.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Culture\">Culture</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The cultures of Taiwan are a hybrid
        blend of various sources, incorporating elements of traditional Chinese culture,
        attributable to the historical and ancestry origin of the majority of its
        current residents, Japanese culture, traditional Confucianist beliefs, and
        increasingly Western values.</p>\n<p>After their move to Taiwan, the Kuomintang
        imposed an official interpretation of traditional Chinese culture over Taiwan.
        The government launched a program promoting Chinese calligraphy, traditional
        Chinese painting, folk art, and Chinese opera.</p>\n<p>The status of Taiwanese
        culture is debated. It is disputed whether Taiwanese culture is a regional
        form of Chinese culture or a distinct culture. Reflecting the continuing controversy
        surrounding the political status of Taiwan, politics continues to play a role
        in the conception and development of a Taiwanese cultural identity, especially
        in the prior dominant frame of a Taiwanese and Chinese dualism. In recent
        years, the concept of Taiwanese multiculturalism has been proposed as a relatively
        apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders
        and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture
        as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought
        and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan. Identity politics, along with
        the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has
        led to distinct traditions in many areas, including cuisine and music.</p>\n\n<p>One
        of Taiwan''s greatest attractions is the National Palace Museum, which houses
        more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting, and
        porcelain and is considered one of the greatest collections of Chinese art
        and objects in the world. The KMT moved this collection from the Forbidden
        City in Beijing in 1933 and part of the collection was eventually transported
        to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. The collection, estimated to be one-tenth
        of China''s cultural treasures, is so extensive that only 1% is on display
        at any time. The PRC had said that the collection was stolen and has called
        for its return, but the ROC has long defended its control of the collection
        as a necessary act to protect the pieces from destruction, especially during
        the Cultural Revolution. Relations regarding this treasure have warmed recently;
        Beijing Palace Museum Curator Zheng Xinmiao said that artefacts in both Chinese
        and Taiwanese museums are \"China''s cultural heritage jointly owned by people
        across the Taiwan Strait.\"</p>\n<p>The classical music culture in Taiwan
        is highly developed and features artists such as violinist Cho-Liang Lin,
        pianist Ching-Yun Hu, and the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society Artist
        Director Wu Han. Karaoke, drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely
        popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like
        style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms varying on the number of guests
        in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to
        form all-encompassing elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or
        businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV''s, equipped
        not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment
        counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the
        city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theatre
        room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a
        place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.</p>\n<p>Taiwan
        has a high density of 24-hour convenience stores, which, in addition to the
        usual services, provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government
        agencies such as collection of parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation
        fines, and credit card payments. They also provide a service for mailing packages.</p>\n<p>Taiwanese
        culture has also influenced other cultures. Bubble tea and milk tea are available
        in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Taiwan television
        shows are popular in Singapore, Malaysia, and other Asian countries. Taiwanese
        films have won various international awards at film festivals around the world.
        Ang Lee, a Taiwanese director, has directed critically acclaimed films such
        as: <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>; <i>Eat Drink Man Woman</i>; <i>Sense
        and Sensibility</i>; <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>; <i>Life of Pi</i>; and <i>Lust,
        Caution</i>. Other famous Taiwanese directors include Tsai Ming-Liang, Edward
        Yang, and Hou Hsiao-hsien.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sports\">Sports</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Baseball
        is Taiwan''s national sport and it is a popular spectator sport. Two of the
        most famous Taiwanese baseball pitchers are Chien-Ming Wang and Wei-Yin Chen;
        both are pitchers in Major League Baseball. Other notable players playing
        in the United States include Chin-hui Tsao who played for the Colorado Rockies
        (2003\u20132005) and the Los Angeles Dodgers (2007, 2015\u20132016), Hong-Chih
        Kuo, Fu-Te Ni, and Chin-lung Hu. The Chinese Professional Baseball League
        in Taiwan was established in 1989, and eventually absorbed the competing Taiwan
        Major League in 2003. As of 2015, the CPBL has four teams with average attendance
        over 5,000 per game.</p>\n<p>Besides baseball, basketball is Taiwan''s major
        sport. Taekwondo has also become a mature and successful sport in recent years.
        In the 2004 Olympics, Chen Shih-hsin and Chu Mu-yen won the first two gold
        medals in women''s flyweight event and men''s flyweight event, respectively.
        Subsequent taekwondo competitors such as Yang Shu-chun have strengthened Taiwan''s
        taekwondo culture.</p>\n<p>Taiwan participates in international sporting organizations
        and events under the name of \"Chinese Taipei\" due to its political status.
        In 2009, Taiwan hosted two international sporting events on the island. The
        World Games 2009 were held in Kaohsiung between 16 and 26 July 2009. Taipei
        hosted the 21st Summer Deaflympics in September of the same year. Furthermore,
        Taipei will host the Summer Universiade in 2017.</p>\n<p>Taiwan is also a
        major Asian country for Korfball. In 2008, Taiwan hosted the World Youth Korfball
        Championship and took the silver medal. In 2009, Taiwan''s korfball team won
        a bronze medal at the World Game.</p>\n<p>Yani Tseng is the most famous Taiwanese
        professional golfer currently playing on the US-based LPGA Tour. She is the
        youngest player ever, male or female, to win five major championships and
        had been ranked number 1 in the Women''s World Golf Rankings for 109 consecutive
        weeks from 2011 to 2013.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Calendar\">Calendar</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taiwan
        uses two official calendars: the Gregorian calendar and the Minguo calendar.
        The latter numbers years starting from 1911, the year of the founding of the
        Republic of China. For example, 2007 was the \"96th year of the Republic\"
        (\u6c11\u570b96\u5e74), while its months and days were numbered according
        to the Gregorian calendar.</p>\n<p>Usually, year numbering may use the Gregorian
        system as well as the ROC era system. For example, 3 May 2004, may be written
        2004-05-03 or 93-05-03. The use of two different calendar systems in Taiwan
        may be confusing, in particular for foreigners. For instance, products for
        export marked using the Minguo calendar can be misunderstood as having an
        expiration date 11\u00a0years earlier than intended.</p>\n<p>Taiwan also uses
        the lunar calendar for traditional festivals such as the Chinese New Year,
        the Lantern Festival, and the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See

        officially the <b>Republic of China</b> (<b>ROC</b>), is a state in East Asia.
        Its neighbors include the People''s Republic of China to the west, Japan to
        the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous
        state and largest economy that is not a member of the United Nations.</p>\n<p>The
        island of Taiwan, formerly known as Formosa, was inhabited by Taiwanese aborigines
        before the 17th century, when Dutch and Spanish colonies opened the island
        to mass Han immigration. After a brief rule by the Kingdom of Tungning, the
        island was annexed by the Qing dynasty, the last dynasty of China. The Qing
        ceded Taiwan to Japan in 1895 after the Sino-Japanese War. While Taiwan was
        under Japanese rule, the Republic of China (ROC) was established on the mainland
        in 1912 after the fall of the Qing dynasty. Following the Japanese surrender
        to the Allies in 1945, the ROC took control of Taiwan. However, the resumption
        of the Chinese Civil War led to the ROC''s loss of the mainland to the Communists,
        and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949. Although the ROC continued
        to claim to be the legitimate government of China, its effective jurisdiction
        has, since the loss of Hainan in 1950, been limited to Taiwan and its surrounding
        islands, with the main island making up 99% of its <i>de facto</i> territory.
        As a founding member of the United Nations, the ROC continued to represent
        China at the United Nations until 1971, when the PRC assumed China''s seat,
        causing the ROC to lose its UN membership.</p>\n<p>In the early 1960s, Taiwan
        entered a period of rapid economic growth and industrialization, creating
        a stable industrial economy. In the 1980s and early 1990s, it changed from
        a one-party military dictatorship dominated by the Kuomintang to a multi-party
        democracy with a semi-presidential system. Taiwan is the 22nd-largest economy
        in the world, and its high-tech industry plays a key role in the global economy.
        It is ranked highly in terms of freedom of the press, healthcare, public education,
        economic freedom, and human development. The country benefits from a highly
        skilled workforce and is among the most highly educated countries in the world
        with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education
        degree.</p>\n<p>The PRC has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and
        asserted the ROC is no longer in legitimate existence. Under its One-China
        Policy the PRC refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes
        the ROC. Today 20 countries maintain official ties with the ROC but many other
        states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices and institutions
        that function as <i>de facto</i> embassies and consulates. Although Taiwan
        is fully self-governing, most international organizations in which the PRC
        participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate
        only as a non-state actor. Internally, the major division in politics is between
        the aspirations of eventual Chinese unification or Taiwanese independence,
        though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal.
        The PRC has threatened the use of military force in response to any formal
        declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful
        unification is no longer possible.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><span id=\"Etymology\">Etymology</span></h2>\n\n<p>There
        are various names for the island of Taiwan in use today, derived from explorers
        or rulers by each particular period. The former name Formosa (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u798f\u723e\u6469\u6c99</span>)
        dates from 1542, when Portuguese sailors sighted the main island of Taiwan
        and named it <i>Ilha Formosa</i>, which means \"beautiful island\". The name
        \"Formosa\" eventually \"replaced all others in European literature\" and
        was in common use in English in the early 20th century.</p>\n<p>In the early
        17th century, the Dutch East India Company established a commercial post at
        Fort Zeelandia (modern-day Anping, Tainan) on a coastal sandbar called \"Tayouan\",
        after their ethnonym for a nearby Taiwanese aboriginal tribe, written by the
        Dutch and Portuguese variously as <i>Taiouwang</i>, <i>Tayowan</i>, <i>Teijoan</i>,
        etc. This name was also adopted into the Chinese vernacular (in particular,
        Hokkien, as Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b: <i><span lang=\"nan\">T\u0101i-o\u00e2n/T\u00e2i-o\u00e2n</span></i>)
        as the name of the sandbar and nearby area (Tainan). The modern word \"Taiwan\"
        is derived from this usage, which is seen in various forms (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u5927\u54e1,
        \u5927\u5713, \u5927\u7063, \u81fa\u54e1, \u81fa\u5713</span> and <span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u81fa\u7aa9\u7063</span>)
        in Chinese historical records. The area of modern-day Tainan was the first
        permanent settlement by Western colonists and Chinese immigrants, grew to
        be the most important trading centre, and served as the capital of the island
        until 1887. Use of the current Chinese name (<span lang=\"zh-hant\">\u81fa\u7063</span>)
        was formalized as early as 1684 with the establishment of Taiwan Prefecture.
        Through its rapid development, the entire Formosan mainland eventually became
        known as \"Taiwan\".</p>\n<p>In his <i>Daoyi Zhil\u00fce</i> (1349), Wang
        Dayuan used \"Liuqiu\" as a name for the island of Taiwan, or the part of
        it near to Penghu. Elsewhere, the name was used for the Ryukyu Islands in
        general or Okinawa, the largest of them; indeed the name <i>Ry\u016bky\u016b</i>
        is the Japanese form of <i>Li\u00faqi\u00fa</i>. The name also appears in
        the <i>Book of Sui</i> (636) and other early works, but scholars cannot agree
        on whether these references are to the Ryukyus, Taiwan or even Luzon.</p>\n<p>The
        official name of the state is the \"Republic of China\"; it has also been
        known under various names throughout its existence. Shortly after the ROC''s
        establishment in 1912, while it was still located on the Chinese mainland,
        the government used the short form \"China\" <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3</span></i>
        <span>(<span lang=\"zh\">\u4e2d\u570b</span>),</span> to refer to itself,
        which derives from <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">zh\u014dng</span></i>
        (\"central\" or \"middle\") and <i><span lang=\"zh-latn-pinyin\">gu\u00f3</span></i>
        (\"state, nation-state\"),  A term which also developed under the Zhou Dynasty
        in reference to its royal demesne and the name was then applied to the area
        around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China''s
        Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under
        the Qingera . During the 1950s and 1960s, after the government had fled to
        Taiwan due to losing the Chinese Civil War, it was commonly referred to as
        \"<b>Nationalist China</b>\" (or \"Free China\") to differentiate it from
        \"Communist China\" (or \"Red China\"). It was a member of the United Nations
        representing \"<i>China</i>\" until 1971, when it lost its seat to the People''s
        Republic of China. Over subsequent decades, the Republic of China has become
        commonly known as \"Taiwan\", after the island that comprises 99% of the territory
        under its control. In some contexts, especially official ones from the ROC
        government, the name is written as \"Republic of China (Taiwan)\", \"Republic
        of China/Taiwan\", or sometimes \"Taiwan (ROC).\" The Republic of China participates
        in most international forums and organizations under the name \"Chinese Taipei\"
        due to diplomatic pressure from the People''s Republic of China. For instance,
        it is the name under which it has competed at the Olympic Games since 1984,
        and its name as an observer at the World Health Organization.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n\n\n<h3><span id=\"Prehistoric_Taiwan\">Prehistoric
        Taiwan</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Taiwan was joined to the mainland in the Late Pleistocene,
        until sea levels rose about 10,000 years ago. Fragmentary human remains dated
        20,000 to 30,000 years ago have been found on the island, as well as later
        artefacts of a Paleolithic culture.</p>\n<p>Around 6,000 years ago, Taiwan
        was settled by farmers, most likely from mainland China. They are believed
        to be the ancestors of today''s Taiwanese aborigines, whose languages belong
        to the Austronesian language family, but show much greater diversity than
        the rest of the family, which spans a huge area from Maritime Southeast Asia
        west to Madagascar and east as far as New Zealand, Hawaii and Easter Island.
        This has led linguists to propose Taiwan as the urheimat of the family, from
        which seafaring peoples dispersed across Southeast Asia and the Pacific and
        Indian Oceans.</p>\n<p>Han Chinese fishermen began settling in the Penghu
        islands in the 13th century. Hostile tribes, and a lack of valuable trade
        products, meant that few outsiders visited the main island until the 16th
        century. By the 1700''s visits to the coast by fishermen from Fujian, as well
        as Chinese and Japanese pirates, became more frequent.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Opening_in_the_17th_century\">Opening
        in the 17th century</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The Dutch East India Company attempted
        to establish a trading outpost on the Penghu Islands (Pescadores) in 1622,
        but were militarily defeated and driven off by the Ming authorities.</p>\n<p>In
        1624, the company established a stronghold called Fort Zeelandia on the coastal
        islet of Tayouan, which is now part of the main island at Anping, Tainan.
        David Wright, a Scottish agent of the company who lived on the island in the
        1650s, described the lowland areas of the island as being divided among 11
        chiefdoms ranging in size from two settlements to 72. Some of these fell under
        Dutch control, while others remained independent. The Company began to import
        labourers from Fujian and Penghu (Pescadores), many of whom settled.</p>\n<p>In
        1626, the Spanish Empire landed on and occupied northern Taiwan, at the ports
        of Keelung and Tamsui, as a base to extend their trading. This colonial period
        lasted 16 years until 1642, when the last Spanish fortress fell to Dutch forces.</p>\n<p>Following
        the fall of the Ming dynasty, Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), a self-styled Ming
        loyalist, arrived on the island and captured Fort Zeelandia in 1662, expelling
        the Dutch Empire and military from the island. Koxinga established the Kingdom
        of Tungning (1662\u20131683), with his capital at Tainan. He and his heirs,
        Zheng Jing, who ruled from 1662 to 1682, and Zheng Keshuang, who ruled less
        than a year, continued to launch raids on the southeast coast of mainland
        China well into the Qing dynasty era.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Qing_rule\">Qing
        rule</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>In 1683, following the defeat of Koxinga''s grandson
        by an armada led by Admiral Shi Lang of southern Fujian, the Qing dynasty
        formally annexed Taiwan, placing it under the jurisdiction of Fujian province.
        The Qing imperial government tried to reduce piracy and vagrancy in the area,
        issuing a series of edicts to manage immigration and respect aboriginal land
        rights. Immigrants mostly from southern Fujian continued to enter Taiwan.
        The border between taxpaying lands and \"savage\" lands shifted eastward,
        with some aborigines becoming sinicized while others retreated into the mountains.
        During this time, there were a number of conflicts between groups of Han Chinese
        from different regions of southern Fujian, particularly between those from
        Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, and between southern Fujian Chinese and aborigines.</p>\n<p>Northern
        Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were the scene of subsidiary campaigns in the
        Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885). The French occupied Keelung on
        1 October 1884, but were repulsed from Tamsui a few days later. The French
        won some tactical victories but were unable to exploit them, and the Keelung
        Campaign ended in stalemate. The Pescadores Campaign, beginning on 31 March
        1885, was a French victory, but had no long-term consequences. The French
        evacuated both Keelung and the Penghu archipelago after the end of the war.</p>\n<p>In
        1887, the Qing upgraded the island''s administration from Taiwan Prefecture
        of Fujian to Fujian-Taiwan-Province (\u798f\u5efa\u81fa\u7063\u7701), the
        twentieth in the empire, with its capital at Taipei. This was accompanied
        by a modernization drive that included building China''s first railroad.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Japanese_rule\">Japanese rule</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>As the Qing dynasty
        was defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895), Taiwan, along
        with Penghu and Liaodong Peninsula, were ceded in full sovereignty to the
        Empire of Japan by the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Inhabitants on Taiwan and Penghu
        wishing to remain Qing subjects were given a two-year grace period to sell
        their property and move to mainland China. Very few Taiwanese saw this as
        feasible. On 25 May 1895, a group of pro-Qing high officials proclaimed the
        Republic of Formosa to resist impending Japanese rule. Japanese forces entered
        the capital at Tainan and quelled this resistance on 21 October 1895. Guerrilla
        fighting continued periodically until about 1902 and ultimately took the lives
        of 14,000 Taiwanese, or 0.5% of the population. Several subsequent rebellions
        against the Japanese (the Beipu uprising of 1907, the Tapani incident of 1915,
        and the Musha incident of 1930) were all unsuccessful but demonstrated opposition
        to Japanese colonial rule.</p>\n<p>Japanese colonial rule was instrumental
        in the industrialization of the island, extending the railroads and other
        transportation networks, building an extensive sanitation system, and establishing
        a formal education system. Japanese rule ended the practice of headhunting.
        During this period the human and natural resources of Taiwan were used to
        aid the development of Japan and the production of cash crops such as rice
        and sugar greatly increased. By 1939, Taiwan was the seventh greatest sugar
        producer in the world. Still, the Taiwanese and aborigines were classified
        as second- and third-class citizens. After suppressing Chinese guerrillas
        in the first decade of their rule, Japanese authorities engaged in a series
        of bloody campaigns against the mountain aboriginals, culminating in the Musha
        Incident of 1930. Intellectuals and laborers who participated in left-wing
        movements within Taiwan were also arrested and massacred (e.g. Tsi\u00fann
        U\u012b-Su\u00ed(\u8523\u6e2d\u6c34), Masanosuke Watanabe (\u6e21\u8fba\u653f\u4e4b\u8f85)).</p>\n<p>Around
        1935, the Japanese began an island-wide assimilation project to bind the island
        more firmly to the Japanese Empire and people were taught to see themselves
        as Japanese under the Kominka Movement, during which time Taiwanese culture
        and religion were outlawed and the citizens were encouraged to adopt Japanese
        surnames. The \"South Strike Group\" was based at the Taihoku Imperial University
        in Taipei. During World War II, tens of thousands of Taiwanese served in the
        Japanese military. For example, former ROC President Lee Teng-hui''s elder
        brother served in the Japanese navy and was killed in action in the Philippines
        in February 1945. The Imperial Japanese Navy operated heavily out of Taiwanese
        ports. In October 1944, the Formosa Air Battle was fought between American
        carriers and Japanese forces based in Taiwan. Important Japanese military
        bases and industrial centres throughout Taiwan, like Kaohsiung, were targets
        of heavy American bombings. Also during this time, over 2,000 women were forced
        into sexual slavery for Imperial Japanese troops, now euphemistically called
        \"comfort women.\"</p>\n<p>In 1938, there were 309,000 Japanese settlers in
        Taiwan. After World War II, most of the Japanese were expelled and sent to
        Japan.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Republic_of_China\">Republic of China</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During
        Japanese rule of Taiwan, on 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was declared
        with Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (the KMT or Nationalist Party) was proclaimed
        provisional president following the Xinhai Revolution, which itself began
        with the Wuchang Uprising on 10 October 1911, overthrowing the Qing Dynasty
        and ending over two thousand years of imperial rule in China. However, the
        presidency was later given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general who in 1915
        proclaimed himself Emperor of China. In the face of popular condemnation and
        opposition from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to abdicate and re-establish
        the republic.</p>\n<p>Since its founding until 1949 it was based on mainland
        China. Central authority waxed and waned in response to warlordism (1915\u201328)
        after Yuan Shikai''s death in 1916,, Japanese invasion (1937\u201345), and
        the Chinese Civil War (1927\u201349), with central authority strongest during
        the Nanjing Decade (1927\u201337), when most of China came under the control
        of the Kuomintang (KMT) under an authoritarian one-party state.</p>\n<p>After
        the Surrender of Japan, on 25 October 1945, the US Navy ferried ROC troops
        to Taiwan in order to accept the formal surrender of Japanese military forces
        in Taipei on behalf of the Allied Powers, as part of General Order No. 1 for
        temporary military occupation. General Rikichi And\u014d, governor-general
        of Taiwan and commander-in-chief of all Japanese forces on the island, signed
        the receipt and handed it over to General Chen Yi of the ROC military to complete
        the official turnover. Chen Yi proclaimed that day to be \"Taiwan Retrocession
        Day\", but the Allies considered Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to be under
        military occupation and still under Japanese sovereignty until 1952, when
        the Treaty of San Francisco took effect. Although the 1943 Cairo Declaration
        had envisaged returning these territories to China, in the Treaty of San Francisco
        and Treaty of Taipei Japan has renounced all claim to them without specifying
        to what country they were to be surrendered. This introduced the problem of
        the legal status of Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The ROC administration of Taiwan under
        Chen Yi was strained by increasing tensions between Taiwanese-born people
        and newly arrived mainlanders, which were compounded by economic woes, such
        as hyperinflation. Furthermore, cultural and linguistic conflicts between
        the two groups quickly led to the loss of popular support for the new government,
        while the mass movement led by the working committee of the Communist Party
        also aimed to bring down the Kuomintang government. The shooting of a civilian
        on 28 February 1947 triggered island-wide unrest, which was suppressed with
        military force in what is now called the February 28 Incident. Mainstream
        estimates of the number killed range from 18,000 to 30,000. Those killed were
        mainly members of the Taiwanese elite.</p>\n\n<p>After the end of World War
        II, the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Chinese Nationalists (Kuomintang),
        led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong.
        Throughout the months of 1949, a series of Chinese Communist offensives led
        to the capture of its capital Nanjing on 23 April and the subsequent defeat
        of the Nationalist army on the mainland, and the Communists founded the People''s
        Republic of China on 1 October.</p>\n<p>On 7 December 1949, after the loss
        of four capitals, Chiang evacuated his Nationalist government to Taiwan and
        made Taipei the temporary capital of the ROC (also called the \"wartime capital\"
        by Chiang Kai-shek). Some 2 million people, consisting mainly of soldiers,
        members of the ruling Kuomintang and intellectual and business elites, were
        evacuated from mainland China to Taiwan at that time, adding to the earlier
        population of approximately six million. In addition, the ROC government took
        to Taipei many national treasures and much of China''s gold reserves and foreign
        currency reserves.</p>\n<p>After losing most of the mainland, the Kuomintang
        held remaining control of Tibet, the portions of Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Yunnan
        provinces along with the Hainan Island until 1951 before the Communists subsequently
        captured both territories. From this point onwards, the Kuomintang''s territory
        was reduced to Taiwan, Penghu, the portions of the Fujian province (Kinmen
        and Matsu Islands), and two major islands of Dongsha Islands and Nansha Islands.
        The Kuomintang continued to claim sovereignty over all \"China\", which it
        defined to include mainland China, Taiwan, Outer Mongolia and other areas.
        On mainland China, the victorious Communists claimed they ruled the sole and
        only China (which they claimed included Taiwan) and that the Republic of China
        no longer existed.</p>\n\n<h4><span id=\"Chinese_Nationalist_one-party_rule\">Chinese
        Nationalist one-party rule</span></h4>\n<p>Martial law, declared on Taiwan
        in May 1949, continued to be in effect after the central government relocated
        to Taiwan. It was not repealed until 1987, and was used as a way to suppress
        the political opposition in the intervening years. During the White Terror,
        as the period is known, 140,000 people were imprisoned or executed for being
        perceived as anti-KMT or pro-Communist. Many citizens were arrested, tortured,
        imprisoned and executed for their real or perceived link to the Communists.
        Since these people were mainly from the intellectual and social elite, an
        entire generation of political and social leaders was decimated. In 1998 law
        was passed to create the \"Compensation Foundation for Improper Verdicts\"
        which oversaw compensation to White Terror victims and families. President
        Ma Ying-jeou made an official apology in 2008, expressing hope that there
        will never be a tragedy similar to White Terror.</p>\n<p>Initially, the United
        States abandoned the KMT and expected that Taiwan would fall to the Communists.
        However, in 1950 the conflict between North Korea and South Korea, which had
        been ongoing since the Japanese withdrawal in 1945, escalated into full-blown
        war, and in the context of the Cold War, US President Harry S. Truman intervened
        again and dispatched the US Navy''s 7th Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent
        hostilities between Taiwan and mainland China. In the Treaty of San Francisco
        and the Treaty of Taipei, which came into force respectively on 28 April 1952
        and 5 August 1952, Japan formally renounced all right, claim and title to
        Taiwan and Penghu, and renounced all treaties signed with China before 1942.
        Neither treaty specified to whom sovereignty over the islands should be transferred,
        because the United States and the United Kingdom disagreed on whether the
        ROC or the PRC was the legitimate government of China. Continuing conflict
        of the Chinese Civil War through the 1950s, and intervention by the United
        States notably resulted in legislation such as the Sino-American Mutual Defense
        Treaty and the Formosa Resolution of 1955.</p>\n\n<p>As the Chinese Civil
        War continued without truce, the government built up military fortifications
        throughout Taiwan. Within this effort, KMT veterans built the now famous Central
        Cross-Island Highway through the Taroko Gorge in the 1950s. The two sides
        would continue to engage in sporadic military clashes with seldom publicized
        details well into the 1960s on the China coastal islands with an unknown number
        of night raids. During the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in September 1958,
        Taiwan''s landscape saw Nike-Hercules missile batteries added, with the formation
        of the 1st Missile Battalion Chinese Army that would not be deactivated until
        1997. Newer generations of missile batteries have since replaced the Nike
        Hercules systems throughout the island.</p>\n<p>During the 1960s and 1970s,
        the ROC maintained an authoritarian, single-party government while its economy
        became industrialized and technology oriented. This rapid economic growth,
        known as the Taiwan Miracle, was the result of a fiscal regime independent
        from mainland China and backed up, among others, by the support of US funds
        and demand for Taiwanese products. In the 1970s, Taiwan was economically the
        second fastest growing state in Asia after Japan. Taiwan, along with Hong
        Kong, South Korea and Singapore, became known as one of the Four Asian Tigers.
        Because of the Cold War, most Western nations and the United Nations regarded
        the ROC as the sole legitimate government of China until the 1970s. Later,
        especially after the termination of the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty,
        most nations switched diplomatic recognition to the PRC (see United Nations
        General Assembly Resolution 2758).</p>\n<p>Up until the 1970s, the government
        was regarded by Western critics as undemocratic for upholding martial law,
        for severely repressing any political opposition and for controlling media.
        The KMT did not allow the creation of new parties and those that existed did
        not seriously compete with the KMT. Thus, competitive democratic elections
        did not exist. From the late 1970s to the 1990s, however, Taiwan went through
        reforms and social changes that transformed it from an authoritarian state
        to a democracy. In 1979, a pro-democracy protest known as the Kaohsiung Incident
        took place in Kaohsiung to celebrate Human Rights Day. Although the protest
        was rapidly crushed by the authorities, it is today considered as the main
        event that united Taiwan''s opposition.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Democratization\">Democratization</span></h4>\n\n<p>Chiang
        Ching-kuo, Chiang Kai-shek''s son and successor as the president, began to
        liberalize the political system in the mid-1980s. In 1984, the younger Chiang
        selected Lee Teng-hui, a Taiwanese-born, US-educated technocrat, to be his
        vice-president. In 1986, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was formed
        and inaugurated as the first opposition party in the ROC to counter the KMT.
        A year later, Chiang Ching-kuo lifted martial law on the main island of Taiwan
        (martial law was lifted on Penghu in 1979, Matsu island in 1992 and Kinmen
        island in 1993). With the advent of democratization, the issue of the political
        status of Taiwan gradually resurfaced as a controversial issue where, previously,
        the discussion of anything other than unification under the ROC was taboo.</p>\n<p>After
        the death of Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988, Lee Teng-hui succeeded him
        as president. Lee continued to democratize the government and decrease the
        concentration of government authority in the hands of mainland Chinese. Under
        Lee, Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which Taiwanese culture
        and history were promoted over a pan-China viewpoint in contrast to earlier
        KMT policies which had promoted a Chinese identity. Lee''s reforms included
        printing banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of
        Taiwan, and streamlining the Taiwan Provincial Government with most of its
        functions transferred to the Executive Yuan. Under Lee, the original members
        of the Legislative Yuan and National Assembly(a former supreme legislative
        body defunct in 2005\uff09, elected in 1947 to represent mainland Chinese
        constituencies and having held the seats without re-election for more than
        four decades, were forced to resign in 1991. The previously nominal representation
        in the Legislative Yuan was brought to an end, reflecting the reality that
        the ROC had no jurisdiction over mainland China, and vice versa. Restrictions
        on the use of Taiwanese Hokkien in the broadcast media and in schools were
        also lifted.</p>\n\n<p>Democratic reforms continued in the 1990s, with Lee
        Teng-hui re-elected in 1996, in the first direct presidential election in
        the history of the ROC. During the later years of Lee''s administration, he
        was involved in corruption controversies relating to government release of
        land and weapons purchase, although no legal proceedings commenced. In 1997,\"To
        meet the requisites of the nation prior to national unification\", the Additional
        Articles of the Constitution of the Republic of China was passed and then
        the former \"constitution of five powers\" turns to be more tripartite. In
        2000, Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party was elected as the
        first non-Kuomintang (KMT) President and was re-elected to serve his second
        and last term since 2004. Polarized politics has emerged in Taiwan with the
        formation of the Pan-Blue Coalition of parties led by the KMT, favouring eventual
        Chinese reunification, and the Pan-Green Coalition of parties led by the DPP,
        favouring an eventual and official declaration of Taiwanese independence.
        In early 2006, President Chen Shui-bian remarked: \u201cThe National Unification
        Council will cease to function. No budget will be ear-marked for it and its
        personnel must return to their original posts...The National Unification Guidelines
        will cease to apply.\"</p>\n\n<p>On 30 September 2007, the ruling DPP approved
        a resolution asserting a separate identity from China and called for the enactment
        of a new constitution for a \"normal country\". It also called for general
        use of \"Taiwan\" as the country''s name, without abolishing its formal name,
        the Republic of China. The Chen administration also pushed for referendums
        on national defence and UN entry in the 2004 and 2008 elections, which failed
        due to voter turnout below the required legal threshold of 50% of all registered
        voters. The Chen administration was dogged by public concerns over reduced
        economic growth, legislative gridlock due to a pan-blue, opposition-controlled
        Legislative Yuan and corruption involving the First Family as well as government
        officials.</p>\n<p>The KMT increased its majority in the Legislative Yuan
        in the January 2008 legislative elections, while its nominee Ma Ying-jeou
        went on to win the presidency in March of the same year, campaigning on a
        platform of increased economic growth and better ties with the PRC under a
        policy of \"mutual nondenial\". Ma took office on 20 May 2008, the same day
        that President Chen Shui-bian stepped down and was notified by prosecutors
        of possible corruption charges. Part of the rationale for campaigning for
        closer economic ties with the PRC stems from the strong economic growth China
        attained since joining the World Trade Organization. However, some analysts
        say that despite the election of Ma Ying-jeou, the diplomatic and military
        tensions with the PRC have not been reduced.</p>\n<p>On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional
        Court ruled that current marriage laws are unconstitutional and that same-sex
        couples in the Taiwanese LGBT community should have the right to marry. The
        court has given the Legislative Yuan two years to adequately amend Taiwanese
        marriage laws. According to the court ruling, if amendments are not passed
        within two years, same-sex marriages will automatically become legal in Taiwan.</p>\n<h2><span

        making it the world''s 137th-largest country/dependency, smaller than Switzerland
        and larger than Belgium.</p>\n<p>The island of Taiwan has an area of 35,883\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>
        (13,855\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and lies some 180 kilometres (110\u00a0mi) from
        the southeastern coast of mainland China across the Taiwan Strait. The East
        China Sea lies to the north, the Philippine Sea to the east, the Bashi Channel
        of the Luzon Strait directly to the south, and the South China Sea to the
        southwest. Its shape is similar to a sweet potato, giving rise to the name
        <i>sweet potato</i> used by Taiwanese Hokkien speakers for people of Taiwanese
        descent.</p>\n<p>The island is characterized by the contrast between the eastern
        two-thirds, consisting mostly of rugged mountains running in five ranges from
        the northern to the southern tip of the island, and the flat to gently rolling
        Chianan Plains in the west that are also home to most of Taiwan''s population.
        Taiwan''s highest point is Yu Shan (Jade Mountain) at 3,952 metres (12,966\u00a0ft),
        making Taiwan the world''s fourth-highest island.</p>\n<p>The Penghu Islands,
        50\u00a0km (31.1\u00a0mi) west of the main island, have an area of 126.9\u00a0km<sup>2</sup>
        (49.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). More distant islands controlled by the Republic of
        China are the Kinmen, Wuchiu and Matsu Islands off the coast of Fujian, with
        a total area of 180.5\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (69.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and the

        of 2.9\u00a0km<sup>2</sup> (1.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and no permanent inhabitants.
        The ROC government also claims the Senkaku Islands to the northeast, which
        are controlled by Japan.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Climate\">Climate</span></h3>\n<p>Taiwan
        lies on the Tropic of Cancer, and its general climate is marine tropical.
        The northern and central regions are subtropical, whereas the south is tropical
        and the mountainous regions are temperate. The average rainfall is 2,600 millimetres
        (100 inches) per year for the island proper; the rainy season is concurrent
        with the onset of the summer East Asian Monsoon in May and June. The entire
        island experiences hot, humid weather from June through September. Typhoons
        are most common in July, August and September. During the winter (November
        to March), the northeast experiences steady rain, while the central and southern
        parts of the island are mostly sunny.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Geology\">Geology</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        island of Taiwan lies in a complex tectonic area between the Yangtze Plate
        to the west and north, the Okinawa Plate on the north-east, and the Philippine
        Mobile Belt on the east and south. The upper part of the crust on the island
        is primarily made up of a series of terranes, mostly old island arcs which
        have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the Eurasian
        Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. These have been further uplifted as a
        result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was subducted
        beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust
        under Taiwan more buoyant.</p>\n<p>The east and south of Taiwan are a complex
        system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between
        the North Luzon Trough portion of the Luzon Volcanic Arc and South China,
        where accreted portions of the Luzon Arc and Luzon forearc form the eastern
        Coastal Range and parallel inland Longitudinal Valley of Taiwan respectively.</p>\n<p>The
        major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between
        the various terranes. These have produced major quakes throughout the history
        of the island. On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the \"921 earthquake\"
        killed more than 2,400 people. The seismic hazard map for Taiwan by the USGS
        shows 9/10 of the island as the highest rating (most hazardous).</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Political_and_legal_status\">Political and legal status</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The
        political and legal statuses of Taiwan are contentious issues. The People''s
        Republic of China (PRC) claims that the Republic of China government is illegitimate,
        referring to it as the \"Taiwan Authority\" even though current ROC territories
        have never been controlled by the PRC. The ROC has its own constitution, independently
        elected president and armed forces. It has not formally renounced its claim
        to the mainland, but ROC government publications have increasingly downplayed
        it.</p>\n<p>Internationally, there is controversy on whether the ROC still
        exists as a state or a defunct state per international law due to the lack
        of wide diplomatic recognition. In a poll of Taiwanese aged 20 and older taken
        by TVBS in March 2009, a majority of 64% opted for the \"status quo\", while
        19% favoured \"independence\" and 5% favoured \"unification\".</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Relations_with_the_PRC\">Relations with the PRC</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        political environment is complicated by the potential for military conflict
        should Taiwan declare de jure independence; it is the official PRC policy
        to use force to ensure unification if peaceful unification is no longer possible,
        as stated in its anti-secession law, and for this reason there are substantial
        military installations on the Fujian coast.</p>\n<p>On 29 April 2005, Kuomintang
        Chairman Lien Chan travelled to Beijing and met with Communist Party of China
        (CPC) Secretary-General Hu Jintao, the first meeting between the leaders of
        the two parties since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. On 11 February
        2014, Mainland Affairs Council Head Wang Yu-chi travelled to Nanjing and met
        with Taiwan Affairs Office Head Zhang Zhijun, the first meeting between high-ranking
        officials from either side. Zhang paid a reciprocal visit to Taiwan and met
        Wang on 25 June 2014, making Zhang the first minister-level PRC official to
        ever visit Taiwan. On 7 November 2015, Ma Ying-jeou (in his capacity as <i>Leader
        of Taiwan</i>) and Xi Jinping (in his capacity as <i>Leader of Mainland China</i>)
        travelled to Singapore and met up, marking the highest-level exchange between
        the two sides since 1949.</p>\n<p>The PRC supports a version of the One-China
        policy, which states that Taiwan and mainland China are both part of China,
        and that the PRC is the only legitimate government of China. It uses this
        policy to prevent the international recognition of the ROC as an independent
        sovereign state, meaning that Taiwan participates in international forums
        under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". With the emergence of the Taiwanese independence
        movement, the name \"Taiwan\" has been employed increasingly often on the
        island.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Foreign_relations\">Foreign relations</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before
        1928, the foreign policy of Republican China was complicated by a lack of
        internal unity\u2014competing centres of power all claimed legitimacy. This
        situation changed after the defeat of the Peiyang Government by the Kuomintang,
        which led to widespread diplomatic recognition of the Republic of China.</p>\n<p>After
        the KMT''s retreat to Taiwan, most countries, notably the countries in the
        Western Bloc, continued to maintain relations with the ROC. Due to diplomatic
        pressure, recognition gradually eroded and many countries switched recognition
        to the PRC in the 1970s. UN Resolution 2758 (25 October 1971) recognized the
        People''s Republic of China as China''s sole representative in the United
        Nations.</p>\n<p>The PRC refuses to have diplomatic relations with any nation
        that recognizes the ROC, and requires all nations with which it has diplomatic
        relations to make a statement recognizing its claims to Taiwan. As a result,
        only 19\u00a0UN member states and the Holy See maintain official diplomatic
        relations with the Republic of China. The ROC maintains unofficial relations
        with most countries via <i>de facto</i> embassies and consulates called Taipei
        Economic and Cultural Representative Offices (TECRO), with branch offices
        called \"Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices\" (TECO). Both TECRO and TECO
        are \"unofficial commercial entities\" of the ROC in charge of maintaining
        diplomatic relations, providing consular services (i.e. visa applications),
        and serving the national interests of the ROC in other countries.</p>\n<p>The
        United States remains one of the main allies of the country and, through the
        Taiwan Relations Act passed in 1979, has continued selling arms and providing
        military training to the Armed Forces. This situation continues to be an issue
        for the People''s Republic of China which considers US involvement disruptive
        to the stability of the region. In January 2010, the Obama administration
        announced its intention to sell $6.4 billion worth of military hardware to
        Taiwan. As a consequence, the PRC threatened the US with economic sanctions
        and warned that their co-operation on international and regional issues could
        suffer.</p>\n<p>The official position of the United States is that the PRC
        is expected to \"use no force or threat[en] to use force against Taiwan\"
        and the ROC is to \"exercise prudence in managing all aspects of Cross-Strait
        relations.\" Both are to refrain from performing actions or espousing statements
        \"that would unilaterally alter Taiwan''s status.\"</p>\n<p>On 16 December
        2015, the Obama administration announced a deal to sell $1.83 billion worth
        of arms to the armed forces of the ROC. China''s foreign ministry had expressed
        its disapproval for the sales and issued the US a \"stern warning\", saying
        it would hurt China\u2013US relations.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Participation_in_international_events_and_organizations\">Participation
        in international events and organizations</span></h3>\n\n<p>The ROC was a
        founding member of the United Nations, and held the seat of China on the Security
        Council and other UN bodies until 1971, when it was expelled by Resolution
        2758 and replaced in all UN organs with the PRC. Each year since 1992, the
        ROC has petitioned the UN for entry, but its applications have not made it
        past committee.</p>\n\n<p>Due to its limited international recognition, the
        Republic of China is a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization,
        represented by a government-funded organization, the Taiwan Foundation for
        Democracy (TFD) under the name \"Taiwan\".</p>\n<p>Also due to its One China
        policy, the PRC only participates in international organizations where the
        ROC is not recognized as a sovereign country. Most member states, including
        the United States, do not wish to discuss the issue of the ROC''s political
        status for fear of souring diplomatic ties with the PRC. However, both the
        US and Japan publicly support the ROC''s bid for membership in the World Health
        Organization as an observer. However, though the ROC sought to participate
        in the WHO since 1997, their efforts were blocked by the PRC until 2010, when
        they were invited as observers to attend the World Health Assembly, under
        the name \"Chinese Taipei\".</p>\n<p>Due to PRC pressure, the ROC is forced
        to use the name \"Chinese Taipei\" in international events, such as the Olympic
        Games, where the PRC is also a party. The ROC is typically barred from using
        its national anthem and national flag in international events due to PRC pressure;
        ROC spectators attending events such as the Olympics are often barred from
        bringing ROC flags into venues. Taiwan also participates in the Asia-Pacific
        Economic Cooperation forum (since 1991) and the World Trade Organization (since
        2002) under the name \"Chinese Taipei\". The ROC is able to participate as
        \"China\" in organizations that the PRC does not participate in, such as the
        World Organization of the Scout Movement.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Opinions_within_Taiwan\">Opinions
        within Taiwan</span></h3>\n\n<p>Within Taiwan, opinions are polarized between
        those supporting unification, represented by the Pan-Blue Coalition of parties,
        and those supporting independence, represented by the Pan-Green Coalition.</p>\n<p>The
        KMT, the largest Pan-Blue party, supports the status quo for the indefinite
        future with a stated ultimate goal of unification. However, it does not support
        unification in the short term with the PRC as such a prospect would be unacceptable
        to most of its members and the public. Ma Ying-jeou, chairman of the KMT and
        former president of the ROC, has set out democracy, economic development to
        a level near that of Taiwan, and equitable wealth distribution as the conditions
        that the PRC must fulfill for reunification to occur.</p>\n<p>The Democratic
        Progressive Party, the largest Pan-Green party, officially seeks independence,
        but in practice also supports the status quo because its members and the public
        would not accept the risk of provoking the PRC.</p>\n<p>On 2 September 2008,
        Mexican newspaper <i>El Sol de M\u00e9xico</i> asked President Ma about his
        views on the subject of \"two Chinas\" and if there was a solution for the
        sovereignty issues between the two. The president replied that the relations
        are neither between two Chinas nor two states. It is a special relationship.
        Further, he stated that the sovereignty issues between the two cannot be resolved
        at present, but he quoted the \"1992 Consensus\", currently accepted by both
        the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China, as a temporary measure until
        a solution becomes available.</p>\n<p>On 27 September 2017, Taiwanese premier
        William Lai said that he was a \u201cpolitical worker who advocates Taiwan
        independence\u201d, but that as Taiwan was an independent country called the
        Republic of China, it had no need to declare independence. The relationship
        with the PRC and the related issues of Taiwanese independence and Chinese
        unification continue to dominate politics.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Government_and_politics\">Government
        and politics</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The government of the Republic of China
        was founded on the Constitution of the ROC and its Three Principles of the
        People, which states that the ROC \"shall be a democratic republic of the
        people, to be governed by the people and for the people.\" The government
        is divided into five branches (<i>Yuan</i>): the Executive Yuan (cabinet),
        the Legislative Yuan (Congress or Parliament), the Judicial Yuan, the Control
        Yuan (audit agency), and the Examination Yuan (civil service examination agency).
        The constitution was drafted before the fall of mainland China to the Communist
        Party of China. It was created by the KMT for the purpose of all of its claimed
        territory, including Taiwan, even though the Communist Party boycotted the
        drafting of the constitution. The constitution went into effect on 25 December
        1947. The ROC remained under martial law from 1948 until 1987 and much of
        the constitution was not in effect. Political reforms beginning in the late
        1970s and continuing through the early 1990s liberalized the country and transformed
        into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic
        of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components
        that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment
        continues. In 2000, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidency,
        ending KMT''s continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National
        Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement
        several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National
        Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of
        constitutional reform to the popular ballot.</p>\n<p>The head of state and
        commander-in-chief of the armed forces is the president, who is elected by
        popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the
        vice-president. The president has authority over the Yuan. The president appoints
        the members of the Executive Yuan as his cabinet, including a premier, who
        is officially the President of the Executive Yuan; members are responsible
        for policy and administration.</p>\n<p>The main legislative body is the unicameral
        Legislative Yuan with 113 seats. Seventy-three are elected by popular vote
        from single-member constituencies; thirty-four are elected based on the proportion
        of nationwide votes received by participating political parties in a separate
        party list ballot; and six are elected from two three-member aboriginal constituencies.
        Members serve four-year terms. Originally the unicameral National Assembly,
        as a standing constitutional convention and electoral college, held some parliamentary
        functions, but the National Assembly was abolished in 2005 with the power
        of constitutional amendments handed over to the Legislative Yuan and all eligible
        voters of the Republic via referendums.</p>\n<p>The premier is selected by
        the president without the need for approval from the legislature, but the
        legislature can pass laws without regard for the president, as neither he
        nor the Premier wields veto power. Thus, there is little incentive for the
        president and the legislature to negotiate on legislation if they are of opposing
        parties. After the election of the pan-Green''s Chen Shui-bian as President
        in 2000, legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the Legislative
        Yuan, which was controlled by a pan-Blue majority. Historically, the ROC has
        been dominated by strongman single party politics. This legacy has resulted
        in executive powers currently being concentrated in the office of the president
        rather than the premier, even though the constitution does not explicitly
        state the extent of the president''s executive power.</p>\n<p>The Judicial
        Yuan is the highest judicial organ. It interprets the constitution and other
        laws and decrees, judges administrative suits, and disciplines public functionaries.
        The president and vice-president of the Judicial Yuan and additional thirteen
        justices form the Council of Grand Justices. They are nominated and appointed
        by the president, with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. The highest court,
        the Supreme Court, consists of a number of civil and criminal divisions, each
        of which is formed by a presiding judge and four associate judges, all appointed
        for life. In 1993, a separate constitutional court was established to resolve
        constitutional disputes, regulate the activities of political parties and
        accelerate the democratization process. There is no trial by jury but the
        right to a fair public trial is protected by law and respected in practice;
        many cases are presided over by multiple judges.</p>\n\n<p>Capital punishment
        is still used in Taiwan, although efforts have been made by the government
        to reduce the number of executions. Nevertheless, according to a survey in
        2006, about 80% of Taiwanese still wanted to keep the death penalty.</p>\n<p>The
        Control Yuan is a watchdog agency that monitors (controls) the actions of
        the executive. It can be considered a standing commission for administrative
        inquiry and can be compared to the Court of Auditors of the European Union
        or the Government Accountability Office of the United States.</p>\n<p>The
        Examination Yuan is in charge of validating the qualification of civil servants.
        It is based on the old imperial examination system used in dynastic China.
        It can be compared to the European Personnel Selection Office of the European
        Union or the Office of Personnel Management of the United States.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Major_camps\">Major camps</span></h3>\n\n<p>The tension between China
        and Taiwan colours most of the political life, and any government move towards
        \"Taiwan independence\" is met by threat of military attack from the PRC.
        The PRC''s official policy is to reunify Taiwan and mainland China under the
        formula of \"one country, two systems\" and refuses to renounce the use of
        military force, especially should Taiwan seek a declaration of independence.</p>\n<p>The
        political scene is generally divided into two major camps in terms of views
        on how Taiwan should relate to China or the PRC, referred to as cross-Strait
        relations. It is the main political difference between two camps: the Pan-Blue
        Coalition, composed of the pro-unification Kuomintang, People First Party
        (PFP), and New Party, who believe that the ROC is the sole legitimate government
        of \"China\" (including Taiwan) and supports eventual Chinese reunification.
        The opposition Pan-Green Coalition is composed of the pro-independence DPP
        and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU). It regards Taiwan as an independent, sovereign
        state synonymous with the ROC, opposes the definition that Taiwan is part
        of \"China\", and seeks wide diplomatic recognition and an eventual declaration
        of formal Taiwan independence. The Pan-Green camp tends to favour emphasizing
        the Republic of China as being a distinct country from the People''s Republic
        of China. Thus, in September 2007, the then ruling Democratic Progressive
        Party approved a resolution asserting separate identity from China and called
        for the enactment of a new constitution for a \"<i>normal country</i>\". It
        called also for general use of \"<i>Taiwan</i>\" as the country''s name, without
        abolishing its formal name, the \"Republic of China\". Some members of the
        coalition, such as former President Chen Shui-bian, argue that it is unnecessary
        to proclaim independence because \"Taiwan is already an independent, sovereign
        country\" and the Republic of China is the same as Taiwan. Despite being a
        member of KMT prior to and during his presidency, Lee Teng-hui also held a
        similar view and was a supporter of the Taiwanization movement.</p>\n<p>Pan-Blue
        members generally support the concept of the One-China policy, which states
        that there is only one China and that its only government is the ROC. They
        favour eventual re-unification of China. The more mainstream Pan-Blue position
        is to lift investment restrictions and pursue negotiations with the PRC to
        immediately open direct transportation links. Regarding independence, the
        mainstream Pan-Blue position is to maintain the status quo, while refusing
        immediate reunification. President Ma Ying-jeou stated that there will be
        no unification nor declaration of independence during his presidency. As of
        2009, Pan-Blue members usually seek to improve relationships with mainland
        China, with a current focus on improving economic ties.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Current_political_issues\">Current
        political issues</span></h3>\n<p>The dominant political issue in Taiwan is
        its relationship with the PRC. For almost 60\u00a0years, there were no direct
        transportation links, including direct flights, between Taiwan and mainland
        China. This was a problem for many Taiwanese businesses that had opened factories
        or branches in mainland China. The former DPP administration feared that such
        links would lead to tighter economic and political integration with mainland
        China, and in the 2006 Lunar New Year Speech, President Chen Shui-bian called
        for managed opening of links. Direct weekend charter flights between Taiwan
        and mainland China began in July 2008 under the current KMT government, and
        the first direct daily charter flights took off in December 2008.</p>\n<p>Other
        major political issues include the passage of an arms procurement bill that
        the United States authorized in 2001. In 2008, however, the United States
        was reluctant to send over more arms to Taiwan out of fear that it would hinder
        the recent improvement of ties between the PRC and the ROC. Another major
        political issue is the establishment of a National Communications Commission
        to take over from the Government Information Office, whose advertising budget
        exercised great control over the media.</p>\n<p>The politicians and their
        parties have themselves become major political issues. Corruption among some
        DPP administration officials has been exposed. In early 2006, President Chen
        Shui-bian was linked to possible corruption. The political effect on President
        Chen Shui-bian was great, causing a divide in the DPP leadership and supporters
        alike. It eventually led to the creation of a political camp led by ex-DPP
        leader Shih Ming-teh which believes the president should resign. The KMT assets
        continue to be another major issue, as it was once the richest political party
        in the world. Nearing the end of 2006, KMT''s chairman Ma Ying-jeou was also
        hit by corruption controversies, although he has since then been cleared of
        any wrongdoings by the courts. After completing his second term as President,
        Chen Shui-bian was charged with corruption and money laundering. Following
        his conviction, he is serving a 17-year sentence in Taipei Prison.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"National_identity\">National identity</span></h3>\n\n<p>Roughly 84% of
        Taiwan''s population descends from Han Chinese who migrated from Qing China
        between 1661 and 1895. Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese
        who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The
        shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical
        separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences,
        as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national
        identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratization
        and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed
        to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart
        of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland
        China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for
        <i>de jure</i> Taiwan independence. The pan-green camp supports a distinct
        Taiwanese identity, while the pan-blue camp supports a Chinese identity only.
        The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a
        Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.</p>\n<p>According to a survey
        conducted in March 2009, 49% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese
        only, and 44% of the respondents consider themselves as Taiwanese and Chinese.
        3% consider themselves as only Chinese. Another survey, conducted in Taiwan
        in July 2009, showed that 82.8% of respondents consider the ROC and the PRC
        as two separate countries with each developing on its own. A survey conducted
        in December 2009 showed that 62% of the respondents consider themselves as
        Taiwanese only, and 22% of the respondents consider themselves as both Taiwanese
        and Chinese. 8% consider themselves as only Chinese. The survey also shows
        that among 18- to 29-year-old respondents, 75% consider themselves as Taiwanese
        only.</p>\n<p>In the latest survey conducted by National Chengchi University
        in 2014 and published in early 2015, 60.6% of respondents identified themselves
        exclusively as Taiwanese, 32.5% identified themselves as both Taiwanese and
        Chinese and 3.5% identified themselves as Chinese.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Military\">Military</span></h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The
        Republic of China Army takes its roots in the National Revolutionary Army,
        which was established by Sun Yat-sen in 1925 in Guangdong with a goal of reunifying
        China under the Kuomintang. When the People''s Liberation Army won the Chinese
        Civil War, much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along
        with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army.
        Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded
        or incorporated into the People''s Liberation Army.</p>\n<p>Today, the Republic
        of China maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as
        defence against the constant threat of invasion by the PRC under the Anti-Secession
        Law of the People''s Republic of China. From 1949 to the 1970s, the primary
        mission of the military was to \"retake the mainland\" through Project National
        Glory. As this mission has shifted to defence, the ROC military has begun
        to shift emphasis from the traditionally dominant Army to the air force and
        navy.</p>\n<p>Control of the armed forces has also passed into the hands of
        the civilian government. As the ROC military shares historical roots with
        the KMT, the older generation of high-ranking officers tends to have Pan-Blue
        sympathies. However, many have retired and there are many more non-mainlanders
        enlisting in the armed forces in the younger generations, so the political
        leanings of the military have moved closer to the public norm in Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The
        ROC began a force reduction program, Jingshi An (translated to streamlining
        program), to scale down its military from a level of 450,000 in 1997 to 380,000
        in 2001. As of 2009, the armed forces of the ROC number approximately 300,000,
        with nominal reserves totalling 3.6\u00a0million as of 2005. Conscription
        remains universal for qualified males reaching age eighteen, but as a part
        of the reduction effort many are given the opportunity to fulfill their draft
        requirement through alternative service and are redirected to government agencies
        or defence related industries. Current plans call for a transition to a predominantly
        professional army over the next decade. Conscription periods are planned to
        decrease from 14\u00a0months to 12. In the last months of the Bush administration,
        Taipei took the decision to reverse the trend of declining defence spending,
        at a time when most Asian countries kept on reducing their military expenditures.
        It also decided to modernize both defensive and offensive capabilities. Taipei
        still keeps a large military apparatus relative to the island''s population:
        defence expenditures for 2008 were NTD 334 billion (approximately US $10.5
        billion), which accounted for 2.94% of GDP.</p>\n\n\n<p>The armed forces''
        primary concern at this time, according to the <i>National Defense Report</i>,
        is the possibility of an invasion by the PRC, consisting of a naval blockade,
        airborne assault, and/or missile bombardment. Four upgraded <i>Kidd</i>-class
        destroyers were purchased from the United States, and commissioned into the
        Republic of China Navy in 2005\u20132006, significantly upgrading Taiwan''s
        air defence and submarine hunting abilities. The Ministry of National Defense
        planned to purchase diesel-powered submarines and Patriot anti-missile batteries
        from the United States, but its budget has been stalled repeatedly by the
        opposition-Pan-Blue Coalition controlled legislature. The defence package
        was stalled from 2001 to 2007 where it was finally passed through the legislature
        and the US responded on 3 October 2008, with a $6.5\u00a0billion arms package
        including PAC III Anti-Air defence systems, AH-64D Apache Attack helicopters
        and other arms and parts. A significant amount of military hardware has been
        bought from the United States, and, as of 2009, continues to be legally guaranteed
        by the Taiwan Relations Act. In the past, France and the Netherlands have
        also sold military weapons and hardware to the ROC, but they almost entirely
        stopped in the 1990s under pressure of the PRC.</p>\n<p>The first line of
        defence against invasion by the PRC is the ROC''s own armed forces. Current
        ROC military doctrine is to hold out against an invasion or blockade until
        the US military responds. There is, however, no guarantee in the Taiwan Relations
        Act or any other treaty that the United States will defend Taiwan, even in
        the event of invasion. The joint declaration on security between the US and
        Japan signed in 1996 may imply that Japan would be involved in any response.
        However, Japan has refused to stipulate whether the \"area surrounding Japan\"
        mentioned in the pact includes Taiwan, and the precise purpose of the pact
        is unclear. The Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS
        Treaty) may mean that other US allies, such as Australia, could theoretically
        be involved. In practice, the risk of losing economic ties with China may
        prevent Australia from taking action. The United States, United Kingdom, Japan,
        South Korea, Australia, Canada, Chile, and Peru conduct maritime exercises
        in the Pacific Ocean every two years called RIMPAC. They are conducted to
        promote stability and to be able to respond in case of an armed conflict in
        the region \u2013 that includes an invasion of Taiwan by China.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Administrative_divisions\">Administrative divisions</span></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According
        to the 1947 constitution, the territory of the ROC is according to its \"existing
        national boundaries\". According to the Executive Yuan in 2012, Mongolia was
        re-recognized by Republic of China as an independent country when the constitution
        was announced in 1946.</p>\n<p>When the ROC retreated to Taiwan in 1949, its
        claimed territory consisted of 35 provinces, 12 special municipalities, 1
        special administrative region and 2 autonomous regions. However, since its
        retreat, the ROC has controlled only Taiwan Province and some islands of Fujian
        Province. The ROC also controls the Pratas Islands and Taiping Island in the
        Spratly Islands, which are part of the disputed South China Sea Islands. They
        were placed under Kaohsiung administration after the retreat to Taiwan.</p>\n<p>Since
        1949, the government has made some changes in the area under its control.
        Taipei became a special municipality in 1967 and Kaohsiung in 1979. The two
        provincial governments were \"streamlined\", with their functions transferred
        to the central government (Fujian in 1956 and Taiwan in 1998). In 2010, New
        Taipei, Taichung and Tainan were upgraded to special municipalities. And in
        2014, Taoyuan County was also upgraded to Taoyuan special municipality. This
        brought the top-level divisions to their current state:</p>\n<p>According
        to Article 4 of the Local Government Act, laws pertaining to special municipalities
        also apply to counties with a population exceeding 2 million. This provision
        does not currently apply to any county, although it previously applied to
        Taipei County (now New Taipei City) and Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City).</p>\n<h2><span

        industrialization and rapid growth of Taiwan during the latter half of the
        20th century has been called the \"Taiwan Miracle\". Taiwan is one of the
        \"Four Asian Tigers\" alongside Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.</p>\n<p>Japanese
        rule prior to and during World War II brought changes in the public and private
        sectors, most notably in the area of public works, which enabled rapid communications
        and facilitated transport throughout much of the island. The Japanese also
        improved public education and made it compulsory for all residents of Taiwan.</p>\n<p>By
        1945, hyperinflation was in progress in mainland China and Taiwan as a result
        of the war with Japan. To isolate Taiwan from it, the Nationalist government
        created a new currency area for the island, and began a price stabilization
        program. These efforts significantly slowed inflation.</p>\n<p>When the KMT
        government fled to Taiwan it brought millions of taels (where 1\u00a0tael
        ~1.2\u00a0ozt) of gold and the foreign currency reserve of mainland China,
        which, according to the KMT, stabilized prices and reduced hyperinflation.
        Perhaps more importantly, as part of its retreat to Taiwan, the KMT brought
        the intellectual and business elites from Mainland China. The KMT government
        instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted
        on mainland China. The government also implemented a policy of import-substitution,
        attempting to produce imported goods domestically.</p>\n<p>In 1950, with the
        outbreak of the Korean War, the United States began an aid program which resulted
        in fully stabilized prices by 1952. Economic development was encouraged by
        American economic aid and programs such as the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction,
        which turned the agricultural sector into the basis for later growth. Under
        the combined stimulus of the land reform and the agricultural development
        programs, agricultural production increased at an average annual rate of 4
        per cent from 1952 to 1959, which was greater than the population growth,
        3.6%.</p>\n<p>In 1962, Taiwan had a (nominal) per-capita gross national product
        (GNP) of $170, placing its economy on a par with those of the Democratic Republic
        of the Congo. On a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis, its GDP per capita
        in the early 1960s was $1,353 (in 1990 prices). By 2011 per-capita GNP, adjusted
        for purchasing power parity (PPP), had risen to $37,000, contributing to a
        Human Development Index (HDI) equivalent to that of other developed countries.
        Taiwan''s HDI in 2012 is 0.890, (23rd, very high), according to the UN''s
        new \"Inequality-adjusted HDI\" calculation method.</p>\n<p>In 1974, Chiang
        Ching-kuo implemented the Ten Major Construction Projects, the beginning foundations
        that helped Taiwan transform into its current export driven economy. Since
        the 1990s, a number of Taiwan-based technology firms have expanded their reach
        around the world. Well-known international technology companies headquartered
        in Taiwan include personal computer manufacturers Acer Inc. and Asus, mobile
        phone maker HTC, as well as electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn, which
        makes products for Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. Computex Taipei is a major
        computer expo, held since 1981.</p>\n\n<p>Today Taiwan has a dynamic, capitalist,
        export-driven economy with gradually decreasing state involvement in investment
        and foreign trade. In keeping with this trend, some large government-owned
        banks and industrial firms are being privatized. Real growth in GDP has averaged
        about 8% during the past three decades. Exports have provided the primary
        impetus for industrialization. The trade surplus is substantial, and foreign
        reserves are the world''s fifth largest. The Republic of China has its own
        currency, the New Taiwan dollar.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the 1990s,
        the economic ties between Taiwan and the People''s Republic of China have
        been very prolific. As of 2008, more than US$150 billion have been invested
        in the PRC by Taiwanese companies, and about 10% of the Taiwanese labour force
        works in the PRC, often to run their own businesses. Although the economy
        of Taiwan benefits from this situation, some have expressed the view that
        the island has become increasingly dependent on the Mainland Chinese economy.
        A 2008 white paper by the Department of Industrial Technology states that
        \"Taiwan should seek to maintain stable relation with China while continuing
        to protect national security, and avoiding excessive ''Sinicization'' of Taiwanese
        economy.\" Others argue that close economic ties between Taiwan and Mainland
        China would make any military intervention by the PLA against Taiwan very
        costly, and therefore less probable.</p>\n<p>Taiwan''s total trade in 2010
        reached an all-time high of US$526.04 billion, according to Taiwan''s Ministry
        of Finance. Both exports and imports for the year reached record levels, totalling
        US$274.64 billion and US$251.4 billion, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>In 2001, agriculture
        constituted only 2% of GDP, down from 35% in 1952. Traditional labour-intensive
        industries are steadily being moved offshore and with more capital and technology-intensive
        industries replacing them. High-technology industrial parks have sprung up
        in every region in Taiwan. The ROC has become a major foreign investor in
        the PRC, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. It is
        estimated that some 50,000\u00a0Taiwanese businesses and 1,000,000\u00a0businesspeople
        and their dependents are established in the PRC.</p>\n<p>Because of its conservative
        financial approach and its entrepreneurial strengths, Taiwan suffered little
        compared with many of its neighbours from the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
        Unlike its neighbours, South Korea and Japan, the Taiwanese economy is dominated
        by small and medium-sized businesses, rather than the large business groups.
        The global economic downturn, however, combined with poor policy co-ordination
        by the new administration and increasing bad debts in the banking system,
        pushed Taiwan into recession in 2001, the first whole year of negative growth
        since 1947. Due to the relocation of many manufacturing and labour-intensive
        industries to the PRC, unemployment also reached a level not seen since the
        1970s oil crisis. This became a major issue in the 2004 presidential election.
        Growth averaged more than 4% in the 2002\u20132006 period and the unemployment
        rate fell below 4%.</p>\n<p>The ROC often joins international organizations
        (especially ones that also include the People''s Republic of China) under
        a politically neutral name. The ROC has been a member of governmental trade
        organizations such as the World Trade Organization under the name Separate
        Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei) since
        2002.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Transportation\">Transportation</span></h2>\n\n<p>The
        Ministry of Transportation and Communications of the Republic of China is
        the cabinet-level governing body of the transportation network in Taiwan.
        Taiwan has an extensive highway network, classified into five levels: national
        highways, provincial highways, county routes, township routes, and special
        routes, with the first four being common. Taiwan also has an extensive bus
        network, most of which are run by private bus companies. Inter-city rail services
        are provided by Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) and Taiwan High Speed
        Rail (THSR). Rapid transit systems include the Taipei Metro, Taoyuan Metro
        (incl. the Airport MRT) and Kaohsiung MRT, while Taichung Metro is under construction.
        Major airports include Taiwan Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, Taipei Songshan and Taichung.
        There are currently seven airlines in Taiwan, the largest ones being China
        Airlines and EVA Air. There are four international seaports: Keelung, Kaohsiung,
        Taichung, and Hualien.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Education,_research,_and_academia\"></span><span
        id=\"Education.2C_research.2C_and_academia\">Education, research, and academia</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The
        higher education system was established in Taiwan by Japan during the colonial
        period. However, after the Republic of China took over Taiwan from Japan in
        1945, the system was promptly replaced by the same system as in mainland China
        which mixed with features of the Chinese and American educational systems.</p>\n<p>Taiwan
        is well known for adhering to the Confucian paradigm of valuing education
        as a means to improve one''s socioeconomic position in Taiwanese society.
        Heavy investment and a cultural value for education has catapulted the resource
        poor nation consistently atop the global education rankings. Taiwan is one
        of the top-performing countries in reading literacy, maths and sciences. In
        2015, Taiwanese students achieved one of the world''s best results in mathematics,
        science and literacy, as tested by the Programme for International Student
        Assessment (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils'' scholastic
        performance. The strong scholastic and educational performance of Taiwanese
        students has prompted the nation to build a highly educated labour force that
        possesses a strong background in mathematics and science to cope with the
        current labor market demands of the 21st century.</p>\n<p>The Taiwanese education
        system has been praised for various reasons including its comparatively high
        test results and its major role in ushering Taiwan''s economic development
        while creating one of the world\u2019s most highly educated workforces. The
        country has also been praised for its high university entrance rate where
        the university acceptance rate has increased from around 20 percent before
        the 1970s to 49 percent in 1996 and over 90 percent since 2006, among the
        highest in Asia. The nation''s high university entrance rate has created a
        highly skilled workforce making Taiwan one of the most highly educated countries
        in the world with 68.5% of Taiwanese high school students going on to attend
        university. Taiwan has a high percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary
        education degree where 45 percent of Taiwanese aged 25\u201364 hold a bachelors
        degree or higher compared with the average of 33 percent among member countries
        of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). On the
        other hand, the system has been criticized for placing excessive pressure
        on students and eschewing creativity in favor of rote memorization. In addition,
        the system has been criticized for producing an excess supply of over-educated
        university graduates and a higher unemployment rate. With a large supply of
        university graduates seeking a limited demand of prestigious white collar
        jobs in an environment that is increasingly losing its competitive edge has
        led many degree holders ending up with lower end jobs with salaries far beneath
        than their expectations. Taiwan\u2019s universities have also been under criticism
        for not being able to fully meet the requirements and demands of Taiwan\u2019s
        21st century fast-moving job market citing a skills mismatch among a large
        number of self-assessed overeducated university graduates that don''t fit
        the demands of the modern Taiwanese labor market. The Taiwanese government
        has also been criticized for undermining the economy as it has been unable
        to produce enough jobs to meet the demands of numerous underemployed university
        graduates.</p>\n<p>As the Taiwanese economy is largely science and technology
        based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher
        education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain
        a competitive edge when searching for employment. Although current Taiwanese
        law mandates only nine years of schooling, 95% of junior high graduates go
        on to attend a senior vocational high school, university, junior college,
        trade school, or other higher education institution.</p>\n<p>Many Taiwanese
        students attend cram schools, or bushiban, to improve skills and knowledge
        on problem solving against exams of subjects like mathematics, nature science,
        history and many others. Courses are available for most popular subjects.
        Lessons are organized in lectures, reviews, private tutorial sessions, and
        recitations.</p>\n<p>As of 2013, the literacy rate in Taiwan is 97.15%.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Demographics\">Demographics</span></h2>\n\n<p>Taiwan''s population is
        about 23.4 million, most of whom are on the island proper. The remainder live
        on Penghu (101,758), Kinmen (127,723), and Matsu (12,506).</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Ethnic_groups\">Ethnic groups</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The ROC government
        reports that over 95% of the population is Han, of which the majority includes
        descendants of early Han Chinese immigrants who arrived in Taiwan in large
        numbers starting in the 18th century. Alternatively, the ethnic groups of
        Taiwan may be roughly divided among the Hoklo (70%), the Hakka (14%), the
        Waishengren (14%), and indigenous peoples (2%).</p>\n<p>The Hoklo people are
        the largest Han subgroup (70% of the total population), whose ancestors migrated
        from the coastal southern Fujian region across the Taiwan Strait starting
        in the 17th century. The Hakka comprise about 15% of the total population,
        and descend from Han migrants to Guangdong, its surrounding areas and Taiwan.
        Additional people of Han origin include and descend from the 2 million Nationalists
        who fled to Taiwan following the communist victory on the mainland in 1949.</p>\n<p>The
        indigenous Taiwanese aborigines number about 533,600 and are divided into
        16 recognized groups. The Ami, Atayal, Bunun, Kanakanavu, Kavalan, Paiwan,
        Puyuma, Rukai, Saisiyat, Saaroa, Sakizaya, Sediq, Thao, Truku and Tsou live
        mostly in the eastern half of the island, while the Yami inhabit Orchid Island.</p>\n<h3><span
        id=\"Languages\">Languages</span></h3>\n\n<p>Mandarin is the official national
        language and is spoken by the vast majority of the population of Taiwan. It
        has been the primary language of instruction in schools since the end of Japanese
        rule. As in Hong Kong and Macau, Traditional Chinese is used as the writing
        system in Taiwan.</p>\n<p>The 70% of the population belonging to the Hoklo
        ethnic group speak Taiwanese Hokkien (a variant of the Min Nan speech of Fujian
        province) as their mother tongue, in addition to Mandarin, and many others
        have some degree of understanding. The Hakka ethnic group (15% of the population)
        use Hakka Chinese. Most <i>waishengren</i> speak primarily Mandarin. Although
        Mandarin is the language of instruction in schools and dominates television
        and radio, non-Mandarin Chinese varieties have undergone a revival in public
        life in Taiwan, particularly since restrictions on their use were lifted in
        the 1990s.</p>\n<p>Taiwan''s indigenous languages, the Formosan languages,
        do not belong to the Chinese or Sino-Tibetan language family, but rather to
        the Austronesian language family. Their use among Taiwan''s aboriginal minority
        groups has been in decline as usage of Mandarin has risen. Of the 14 extant
        languages, five are considered moribund.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Religion\">Religion</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>The
        Constitution of the Republic of China protects people''s freedom of religion
        and the practices of belief. There are approximately 18,718,600 religious
        followers in Taiwan as of 2005 (81.3% of total population) and 14\u201318%
        are non-religious. According to the 2005 census, of the 26 religions recognized
        by the ROC government, the five largest are: Buddhism (8,086,000 or 35.1%),
        Taoism (7,600,000 or 33%), Yiguandao (810,000 or 3.5%), Protestantism (605,000
        or 2.6%), and Roman Catholicism (298,000 or 1.3%).</p>\n<p>The CIA World Factbook
        reports that over 93% of Taiwanese are adherents of a combination of the polytheistic
        Chinese popular religion, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism; 4.5% are adherents
        of Christianity, which includes Protestants, Catholics, and other, non-denominational,
        Christian groups; and less than 2.5% are adherents of other religions. Taiwanese
        aborigines comprise a notable subgroup among professing Christians: \"...over
        64% identify as Christian... Church buildings are the most obvious markers
        of Aboriginal villages, distinguishing them from Taiwanese or Hakka villages.\"</p>\n<p>Confucianism
        is a philosophy that deals with secular moral ethics, and serves as the foundation
        of both Chinese and Taiwanese culture. The majority of Taiwanese people usually
        combine the secular moral teachings of Confucianism with whatever religions
        they are affiliated with.</p>\n<p>As of 2009, there were 14,993 temples in
        Taiwan, approximately one place of worship per 1,500 residents. 9,202 of those
        temples were dedicated to Taoism. In 2008, Taiwan had 3,262 Churches, an increase
        of 145.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Largest_cities\">Largest cities</span></h3>\n\n<p>The

        within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering
        the total metropolitan area populations (in such rankings the Taipei-Keelung
        metro area is by far the largest agglomeration).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h2><span
        id=\"Public_health\">Public health</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>Health care in Taiwan
        is managed by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI).</p>\n<p>The
        current program was implemented in 1995, and is considered to be a form of
        social insurance. The government health insurance program maintains compulsory
        insurance for citizens who are employed, impoverished, unemployed, or victims
        of natural disasters with fees that correlate to the individual and/or family
        income; it also maintains protection for non-citizens working in Taiwan. A
        standardized method of calculation applies to all persons and can optionally
        be paid by an employer or by individual contributions.</p>\n<p>BNHI insurance
        coverage requires co-payment at the time of service for most services unless
        it is a preventative health service, for low-income families, veterans, children
        under three years old, or in the case of catastrophic diseases. Low income
        households maintain 100% premium coverage by the BNHI and co-pays are reduced
        for disabled or certain elderly people.</p>\n<p>According to a recently published
        survey, out of 3,360\u00a0patients surveyed at a randomly chosen hospital,
        75.1% of the patients said they are \"very satisfied\" with the hospital service;
        20.5% said they are \"okay\" with the service. Only 4.4% of the patients said
        they are either \"not satisfied\" or \"very not satisfied\" with the service
        or care provided.</p>\n<p>Taiwan has its own Center for Disease Control, and
        during the SARS outbreak in March 2003 there were 347\u00a0confirmed cases.
        During the outbreak the Centers for Disease Control and local governments
        set up monitored stations throughout public transportation, recreational sites
        and other public areas. With full containment in July 2003, there has not
        been a case of SARS since.</p>\n<p>As of 2006, the BNHI Facility Contract
        Distribution facilities total 17,259, including:</p>\n<p>Basic coverage areas
        of the insurance include:</p>\n<p>In 2004, the infant mortality rate was 5.3
        with 15\u00a0physicians and 63\u00a0hospital beds per 10,000\u00a0people.
        The life expectancy for males was 73.5\u00a0years and 79.7\u00a0years for

        of Health was restructured as the Ministry of Health and Welfare.</p>\n<h2><span
        id=\"Culture\">Culture</span></h2>\n\n\n<p>The cultures of Taiwan are a hybrid
        blend of various sources, incorporating elements of traditional Chinese culture,
        attributable to the historical and ancestry origin of the majority of its
        current residents, Japanese culture, traditional Confucianist beliefs, and
        increasingly Western values.</p>\n<p>After their move to Taiwan, the Kuomintang
        imposed an official interpretation of traditional Chinese culture over Taiwan.
        The government launched a program promoting Chinese calligraphy, traditional
        Chinese painting, folk art, and Chinese opera.</p>\n<p>The status of Taiwanese
        culture is debated. It is disputed whether Taiwanese culture is a regional
        form of Chinese culture or a distinct culture. Reflecting the continuing controversy
        surrounding the political status of Taiwan, politics continues to play a role
        in the conception and development of a Taiwanese cultural identity, especially
        in the prior dominant frame of a Taiwanese and Chinese dualism. In recent
        years, the concept of Taiwanese multiculturalism has been proposed as a relatively
        apolitical alternative view, which has allowed for the inclusion of mainlanders
        and other minority groups into the continuing re-definition of Taiwanese culture
        as collectively held systems of meaning and customary patterns of thought
        and behaviour shared by the people of Taiwan. Identity politics, along with
        the over one hundred years of political separation from mainland China, has
        led to distinct traditions in many areas, including cuisine and music.</p>\n\n<p>One
        of Taiwan''s greatest attractions is the National Palace Museum, which houses
        more than 650,000 pieces of Chinese bronze, jade, calligraphy, painting, and
        porcelain and is considered one of the greatest collections of Chinese art
        and objects in the world. The KMT moved this collection from the Forbidden
        City in Beijing in 1933 and part of the collection was eventually transported
        to Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War. The collection, estimated to be one-tenth
        of China''s cultural treasures, is so extensive that only 1% is on display
        at any time. The PRC had said that the collection was stolen and has called
        for its return, but the ROC has long defended its control of the collection
        as a necessary act to protect the pieces from destruction, especially during
        the Cultural Revolution. Relations regarding this treasure have warmed recently;
        Beijing Palace Museum Curator Zheng Xinmiao said that artefacts in both Chinese
        and Taiwanese museums are \"China''s cultural heritage jointly owned by people
        across the Taiwan Strait.\"</p>\n<p>The classical music culture in Taiwan
        is highly developed and features artists such as violinist Cho-Liang Lin,
        pianist Ching-Yun Hu, and the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society Artist
        Director Wu Han. Karaoke, drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely
        popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like
        style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms varying on the number of guests
        in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to
        form all-encompassing elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or
        businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV''s, equipped
        not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment
        counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the
        city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theatre
        room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a
        place that young couples will go to be alone and intimate.</p>\n<p>Taiwan
        has a high density of 24-hour convenience stores, which, in addition to the
        usual services, provide services on behalf of financial institutions or government
        agencies such as collection of parking fees, utility bills, traffic violation
        fines, and credit card payments. They also provide a service for mailing packages.</p>\n<p>Taiwanese
        culture has also influenced other cultures. Bubble tea and milk tea are available
        in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Taiwan television
        shows are popular in Singapore, Malaysia, and other Asian countries. Taiwanese
        films have won various international awards at film festivals around the world.
        Ang Lee, a Taiwanese director, has directed critically acclaimed films such
        as: <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>; <i>Eat Drink Man Woman</i>; <i>Sense
        and Sensibility</i>; <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>; <i>Life of Pi</i>; and <i>Lust,
        Caution</i>. Other famous Taiwanese directors include Tsai Ming-Liang, Edward
        Yang, and Hou Hsiao-hsien.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sports\">Sports</span></h3>\n\n\n<p>Baseball
        is Taiwan''s national sport and it is a popular spectator sport. Two of the
        most famous Taiwanese baseball pitchers are Chien-Ming Wang and Wei-Yin Chen;
        both are pitchers in Major League Baseball. Other notable players playing
        in the United States include Chin-hui Tsao who played for the Colorado Rockies
        (2003\u20132005) and the Los Angeles Dodgers (2007, 2015\u20132016), Hong-Chih
        Kuo, Fu-Te Ni, and Chin-lung Hu. The Chinese Professional Baseball League
        in Taiwan was established in 1989, and eventually absorbed the competing Taiwan
        Major League in 2003. As of 2015, the CPBL has four teams with average attendance
        over 5,000 per game.</p>\n<p>Besides baseball, basketball is Taiwan''s major
        sport. Taekwondo has also become a mature and successful sport in recent years.
        In the 2004 Olympics, Chen Shih-hsin and Chu Mu-yen won the first two gold
        medals in women''s flyweight event and men''s flyweight event, respectively.
        Subsequent taekwondo competitors such as Yang Shu-chun have strengthened Taiwan''s
        taekwondo culture.</p>\n<p>Taiwan participates in international sporting organizations
        and events under the name of \"Chinese Taipei\" due to its political status.
        In 2009, Taiwan hosted two international sporting events on the island. The
        World Games 2009 were held in Kaohsiung between 16 and 26 July 2009. Taipei
        hosted the 21st Summer Deaflympics in September of the same year. Furthermore,
        Taipei will host the Summer Universiade in 2017.</p>\n<p>Taiwan is also a
        major Asian country for Korfball. In 2008, Taiwan hosted the World Youth Korfball
        Championship and took the silver medal. In 2009, Taiwan''s korfball team won
        a bronze medal at the World Game.</p>\n<p>Yani Tseng is the most famous Taiwanese
        professional golfer currently playing on the US-based LPGA Tour. She is the
        youngest player ever, male or female, to win five major championships and
        had been ranked number 1 in the Women''s World Golf Rankings for 109 consecutive
        weeks from 2011 to 2013.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Calendar\">Calendar</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taiwan
        uses two official calendars: the Gregorian calendar and the Minguo calendar.
        The latter numbers years starting from 1911, the year of the founding of the
        Republic of China. For example, 2007 was the \"96th year of the Republic\"
        (\u6c11\u570b96\u5e74), while its months and days were numbered according
        to the Gregorian calendar.</p>\n<p>Usually, year numbering may use the Gregorian
        system as well as the ROC era system. For example, 3 May 2004, may be written
        2004-05-03 or 93-05-03. The use of two different calendar systems in Taiwan
        may be confusing, in particular for foreigners. For instance, products for
        export marked using the Minguo calendar can be misunderstood as having an
        expiration date 11\u00a0years earlier than intended.</p>\n<p>Taiwan also uses
        the lunar calendar for traditional festivals such as the Chinese New Year,
        the Lantern Festival, and the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See
